{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-bf828", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 22302/10) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Raja Arlewin (“the applicant”), on 18 March 2010.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K. Lewis and Mr J. Södergren, lawyers practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Rönquist, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been deprived of effective access to court and that the State had failed to provide him with sufficient protection against allegations that violated his right to privacy.\n\nOn 5 March 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Stockholm. He is self-employed and runs a business.\n\nOn 22 April 2004 the Swedish commercial television channel TV3 broadcast an episode of a television show entitled “Insider”, in which it was claimed that “shady transactions and shady characters” were revealed. The show was broadcast live with a few recorded features. In the show, the applicant, who was unknown to the broader public, appeared in pictures and was mentioned by name. He was singled out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being guilty of several counts of fraud and other economic offences. The programme was re‑broadcast on 25 April and 17 September 2004. At this time, no criminal investigation had been initiated against the applicant.\n\nThe television programme was produced in Sweden by the Swedish company Strix Television AB. It was sent by satellite link from Sweden to the London-based company Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd and from there sent unaltered to a satellite which transmitted the programme to the Swedish audience. The encoded programme was viewable via a satellite receiver or a cable connection in Sweden a fraction of a second after it had been sent by satellite link. Even if it was viewable in the United Kingdom, which is doubtful, it would have been watched there by a small audience. It was presented in the Swedish language for a Swedish-speaking audience, and was sponsored by companies competing in the Swedish market. The anchorman of the show, X, a Swedish national, was a celebrity and a well-known television personality in Sweden; he was also the Chief Executive Officer of Strix Television AB. The show had a long run and was watched by many viewers.\n\nIn October 2006 the applicant brought a private prosecution against X for gross defamation, claiming damages in the amount of 250,000 Swedish kronor (SEK; approximately 27,000 euros). He maintained that he had been unreservedly pointed out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being directly or indirectly responsible for a large number of serious crimes. He further alleged that X was responsible for the content of the programme since he had failed in his duty to appoint a legally responsible editor (ansvarig utgivare) for the programme and because he had been its anchor.\n\nThe applicant relied on Chapters 5 and 6 of the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen, 1991:1469; hereafter “the Constitutional Law”), regarding freedom of expression offences and liability rules, and Chapter 5 of the Penal Code (Brottsbalken), dealing with defamation, as well as Articles 6 § 2, 8 and 13 of the Convention. In the latter respect, he argued that his appearance in the show breached his right to privacy as well as his right to be presumed innocent and that a decision to dismiss his claims would constitute a violation of his right to an effective remedy. The applicant submitted a legal opinion stating that it would be impossible, or at least not useful, to bring an action in the United Kingdom in the present case since the damage flowing from the television programme at issue had not occurred in the United Kingdom.\n\nX disputed the claim on the grounds, inter alia, that he was not the responsible editor of the show and that he enjoyed the freedom to communicate information as provided for under Chapter 10, section 2 of the Constitutional Law and as clarified by the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) in the case NJA 2005 p. 884 (see paragraphs 32 and 33 below).\n\nIn a preliminary ruling on 20 May 2008 the Stockholm District Court (Stockholms tingsrätt) dismissed the claim in so far as it was based on the Constitutional Law. It referred to the Supreme Court judgment in an almost identical case, NJA 2002 p. 314 (see paragraphs 28-31 below), and held that Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable to the television programme since it could not be regarded as emanating from Sweden. This was because the programme had first been sent by satellite link to Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd, the British company responsible for the programme content, and thereafter uplinked to a satellite, which had in turn transmitted the programme to viewers in Sweden. As Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable, X could not be held responsible for the programme content under Chapter 6. The District Court further held that the applicant’s claims under the Penal Code were to be determined following the main hearing in the case. The court finally drew the parties’ attention to the Supreme Court case NJA 2005 p. 884.\n\nThe applicant appealed, repeating what he had stated in his earlier submissions. He further argued that all companies involved in the case were Swedish, including the receiving company in London, allegedly named Viasat AB, with its seat in Stockholm. Although Viasat AB had acquired the right to transmit the show from the Swedish company TV3 AB, it had had no impact on or responsibility for the programme selection. Having regard to the above, the offence committed against the applicant through the programme could not be examined by United Kingdom courts. The applicant also submitted that Swedish courts were competent to examine the case under the Brussels I Regulation (see further paragraph 35 below). X contested the arguments and submitted that it was the company Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd, whose seat was in the United Kingdom, which was responsible for the programme service and decided on the final content of the programmes.\n\nOn 20 March 2009 the Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt) upheld the District Court’s decision. It held that the issue for it to determine was whether the general provisions in the Constitutional Law were applicable to the programme in question, that is, whether or not the broadcasting of the programme could be considered to have originated from Sweden within the meaning of Chapter 1, section 6(2) of that law. It further stated that the burden of proof concerning the applicability of the Constitutional Law rested on the applicant and that he had not, in response to X’s refutation, established that the decisions concerning the programme content were taken in Sweden. Consequently, Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable in the case. The court further held that the material before it indicated that it was possible for the applicant to bring claims before a British court.\n\nThe applicant appealed and referred to his earlier submissions. In addition, he requested that a question concerning the interpretation of the Brussels I Regulation be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling. According to the applicant, the regulation entitled a person claiming non-contractual damages to bring actions where the harmful event occurred. In the present case, the harmful event had occurred in Sweden and the applicant thus should have had the right to bring his action before the Swedish courts. Consequently, the position hitherto taken by the Swedish courts ran contrary to Community law.\n\nOn 21 September 2009 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s referral request and refused leave to appeal in the case. It held that, since the District Court had found itself competent to examine the applicant’s claims in so far as they were based on grounds other than the Constitutional Law, there was no reason to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ.\n\nThe applicant subsequently withdrew his remaining claims before the District Court since there was no practical prospect of success in a continued procedure. On 17 November 2009 the District Court struck the case out of the list and ordered the applicant to pay X’s legal costs and expenses.\n\nCriminal proceedings were taken against the applicant in regard, inter alia, to the matters described in the television programme. He was convicted of aggravated fraud as well as tax and bookkeeping offences and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The criminal proceedings were finalised by a Supreme Court decision to refuse leave to appeal on 4 October 2010. These proceedings, in particular their compliance with Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention, are the subject of an application lodged with the Court on 4 April 2011 (no. 32814/11).", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Raja Arlewin - The applicant, Swedish national born in 1970, lives in Stockholm, self-employed businessman who brought the case against Sweden", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Raja Arlewin", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "54-55", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Stockholm / Sweden", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Sweden", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Business owner", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Business owner", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr K.

Şan, of the Istanbul Bar. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not appoint an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 8 March 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints under Articles 3 and 11 of the Convention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 22 April 2000 the applicant, a lawyer and member of the administrative board of the Istanbul Human Rights Association, organised a demonstration in Sultanahmet Square in Istanbul, in the form of a march followed by a statement to the press, to protest against plans for “F-type” prisons.\n\nAt about 12 noon a group of forty to fifty persons brandishing placards and signs gathered in the square, under the leadership of the applicant and Eren Keskin, a lawyer and President of the Istanbul Human Rights Association. The police asked the group to disperse and to end the gathering, and informed them via a loudspeaker that the demonstration, for which advance notice had not been submitted, was unlawful and was likely to cause public-order problems at a busy time of day.\n\nThe demonstrators refused to obey and attempted to continue marching towards the police, who dispersed the group using a kind of tear gas known as “pepper spray”. The police arrested thirty-nine demonstrators, including the applicant, and took them to a police station.\n\nAfter an identity check, and in view of her profession, the applicant was released at 12.45 p.m.\n\nOn 26 April 2000 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Beyoğlu prosecutor’s office against the head of the Istanbul security police and the police officers concerned, alleging that she had been ill-treated through the use of pepper spray, unlawfully arrested and prevented from making the public statement scheduled for the end of the demonstration.\n\nOn 29 June 2000 the public prosecutor’s office discontinued the proceedings on the ground that no offence had been committed.\n\nOn 25 July 2000 the applicant applied to the Beyoğlu Assize Court seeking to have that decision set aside.\n\nOn 25 September 2000 the Assize Court upheld the decision that there was no case to answer.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Oya Ataman - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1970, lawyer and member of the administrative board of the Istanbul Human Rights Association who organized the demonstration", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Oya Ataman", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "54-55", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Lawyer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Istanbul Human Rights Association", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Administrative board member", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr G.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-18bc2", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 8806/12) against the French Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a French national, Mr Jean-Michel Aycaguer (“the applicant”), on 20 January 2012.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms A.-M. Mendiboure, a lawyer practising in Bayonne. The French Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Alabrune, Director of Legal Affairs with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his conviction for having refused to undergo DNA profiling had amounted to an unjustified infringement of his right to respect for his private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 26 March 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Ossès.\n\nOn 17 January 2008 he attended a rally organised by a Basque agricultural trade union and by the GFAM (a mutual-benefit land alliance), the “Lurra”, on the occasion of a meeting of the Technical Committee of the Land Use and Rural Settlement Corporation (SAFER) in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques Département. That meeting had been aimed at producing an opinion on the use of the land comprising a farm which Mr F.L. had been operating for several years. The rally was held in a political and trade-union situation where tensions had been heightened by the fact that the majority agricultural union in the Département was backing candidates other than Mr F.L. At the end of the meeting scuffles broke out between the demonstrators and the gendarmerie.\n\nThe applicant was placed in police custody and brought before the Bayonne Criminal Court under “immediate summary trial” procedure, and charged with intentional violence not entailing total unfitness for work, against gendarmes whose identity has not been established, and against a person exercising public authority, using or threatening to use a weapon, in this instance an umbrella.\n\nBy judgment of 13 March 2008, the applicant was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, suspended, for having struck gendarmes with an umbrella, which incident had not entailed unfitness for work on the latter’s part. In its judgment, the court noted that the applicant had refused to answer questions during the investigation or to admit to any wrongdoing, and had denied that he had been carrying an umbrella. The judges noted that witnesses had nevertheless stated that he had attempted to cross the barrier by clambering over demonstrators and trying to hit the gendarmes with his umbrella. The applicant pointed out that he had refrained from appealing in order to calm the situation and in the framework of a friendly settlement of the dispute that had been the cause of the rally.\n\nOn 24 December 2008, following a request from the Bayonne Public Prosecutor’s Office, the applicant was ordered by the police to give a DNA sample, on the basis of Articles 706-55 and 706-56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CPP). He was brought before the Criminal Court on 19 May 2009 for refusing to give the sample.\n\nBy judgment of 27 October 2009, the Bayonne Regional Court imposed on the applicant a fine of five hundred euros.\n\nOn 3 February 2011 the Pau Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. As regards the legal aspect of the offence, it stated, in particular, that unlike the applicants in the case of S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, ECHR 2008), the applicant had been convicted, rather than suspected, of an offence, which precluded him from arguing that the impugned judgment had entailed a disproportionate interference with his private life. Relying, in particular, on the 16 September 2010 decision of the Constitutional Council (see paragraph 16 below), it held that “the provisions of national law applied [to the applicant] were such as to reconcile respect for private life and the protection of public order in a manner that was neither manifestly unbalanced nor in breach of the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention”. In connection with the substantive aspect of the offence, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s plea that a sample had already been taken from his headgear during his police custody and that he was entitled to refuse further sampling, given that there had been no DNA profiling the first time.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. His first plea was that the sample geared to identifying his DNA and storing the corresponding data amounted to a disproportionate interference with his private life, having regard to the duration of the data storage and his personal situation (an easily identifiable person who was socially well-established, with a job, a family and a fixed abode). In his second plea, he argued that the Court of Appeal had provided no reasons for its decision in connection with the substantive aspect of the offence.\n\nBy judgment of 28 September 2011, the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as follows: “... the Court of Appeal responded adequately and cogently to the main points of the pleadings submitted to it, and characterised all the substantive and purposive aspects of the offence of refusing to undergo a biological test, of which it found the defendant guilty, in full compliance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Convention.”", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Jean-Michel Aycaguer - The applicant, French national born in 1959, lives in Ossès, convicted for refusing DNA profiling", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Jean-Michel Aycaguer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "65-66", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Ossès / France", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "France", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms A.-M.

It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nOn 18 December 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed assault causing death and dealing in stolen goods.\n\nOn 19 December 2003 the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. It relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and on the risk that he might induce witnesses to give false testimony. Further, the court referred to the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on the applicant.\n\nIn the course of investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended by the Ostrołęka Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 4 March 2004, 11 May 2004 and 10 December 2004. In its decisions, the court relied on the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offence while acting with numerous co-suspects in the ambit of the activities of an organised criminal group. Further, it referred to the need to obtain evidence, in particular: to take evidence from numerous witnesses and suspects and to confront a key witness with the injured persons.\n\nOn 29 September 2004 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to one year and four months’ imprisonment by the Wyszków District Court for failure to pay maintenance and threatening behaviour, charges which has been examined in separate sets of proceedings. The court offset the sentence against the period of pre-trial detention.\n\nOn 23 June 2005 the applicant and twenty three suspects were indicted before the Ostrołęka Regional Court. The bill of indictment against the applicant comprised charges of assault causing death and dealing in stolen goods, committed in the ambit of the activities of an organised criminal group. However, the applicant was not charged with being a member of such a group.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was extended by the Ostrołęka Regional Court on 9 May 2005, 8 December 2005, 9 June 2006, 11 September 2006, 11 June 2007 and on 17 October 2007. The court repeated the grounds given in previous decisions. The court also stated that the reasons for the applicant’s detention were still valid and relied on the likelihood that a severe prison sentence would be imposed on him.\n\nThe applicant appealed against decisions extending his detention. The appeals were dismissed on 1 July 2005, 20 January 2006, 11 July 2006 and 20 October 2006.\n\nOn 1 February 2006 the court ordered that the cases of 8 of the accused be dealt with in separate proceedings.\n\nOn 16 March 2006 and 23 March 2006 the cases of two of the co‑accused were earmarked for separate proceedings.\n\nIn the meantime, on 9 September 2005, on 27 March 2006 and on 19 March 2007 the applicant lodged unsuccessful applications for release. The court stated that the reasons for his detention were still valid.\n\nBetween 13 March 2006 and 4 June 2007 seventy-one hearings took place.\n\nOn 11 June 2007 the Ostrołęka Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe case is pending before the Warsaw Appellate Court (Sąd Apelacyjny).\n\nThe applicant failed to lodge a complaint about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time with the domestic court, under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Mirosław Jabłoński - Polish national applicant, born in 1963, lives in Warsaw, arrested for assault causing death and dealing in stolen goods, convicted and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Mirosław Jabłoński", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "61-62", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Warsaw / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr Jakub Wołąsiewicz - Agent representing the Polish Government, works at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Jakub Wołąsiewicz", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Government Agent", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Agent", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}]}
{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-3999d", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 76900/01) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Mr Karl Öllinger (“the applicant”), on 31 July 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Hager, a lawyer practising in Linz. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, a violation of his right to freedom of assembly.\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 24 March 2005, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe parties did not submit further observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Vienna.\n\nOn 30 October 1998 the applicant, who is a member of parliament for the Green Party, notified the Salzburg Federal Police Authority (Bundespolizeidirektion) under section 2 of the Assembly Act (Versammlungsgesetz) that on All Saints’ Day, 1 November 1998, from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m., he would be holding a meeting at the Salzburg municipal cemetery in front of the war memorial. He noted that the meeting would coincide with the gathering of Comradeship IV (Kameradschaft IV), which he considered to be unlawful.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to be to commemorate the Salzburg Jews killed by the SS during the Second World War. The applicant expected about six participants, who would carry commemorative messages in their hands and attached to their clothes. The applicant stated that no other means of expression (such as chanting or banners) which might offend piety or undermine public order would be used.\n\nOn 31 October 1998 the Salzburg Federal Police Authority, relying on section 6 of the Assembly Act and on Article 11 of the Convention, prohibited the meeting on the ground that it would endanger public order and security.\n\nThe authority noted that F.E., also a member of parliament for the Green Party, had informed the Salzburg Federal Police Authority of the allegedly illegal assembly of Comradeship IV in memory of the SS soldiers killed in the Second World War which was to be held at the same time and place, but had refused to give an undertaking that the proposed meeting in memory of the murdered Salzburg Jews would not disrupt that gathering.\n\nThe Salzburg Federal Police Authority noted that Comradeship IV was a registered association. Like a number of other organisations, it traditionally held a commemoration ceremony at the Salzburg municipal cemetery on All Saints’ Day. Such commemorations qualified as popular ceremonies within the meaning of section 5 of the Assembly Act and thus did not require authorisation. The disruption of this and other commemoration ceremonies was likely to offend the religious feelings of members of the public visiting the cemetery and would indisputably be regarded as disrespectful towards the dead soldiers of both world wars and thus as an unbearable provocation. Accordingly, there was a risk of protests by visitors to the cemetery which could degenerate into open conflict between them and those participating in the assembly.\n\nThe Salzburg Federal Police Authority ordered that any remedies used against its decision should not have suspensive effect. Accordingly, the demonstration could not take place.\n\nOn 17 August 1999 the Salzburg Public Security Authority (Sicherheitsdirektion) dismissed an appeal by the applicant.\n\nIt noted that Comradeship IV was a registered association whose members were mainly former members of the SS. For more than forty years they had commemorated SS soldiers killed in the Second World War by gathering on All Saints’ Day and laying a wreath in front of the war memorial at the Salzburg municipal cemetery. In the past few years, a number of organisations had organised protest campaigns with the aim of disrupting the Comradeship IV commemoration ceremony. These protests had led to vehement discussions with members of Comradeship IV and other visitors to the cemetery and had required intervention by the police.\n\nThe Public Security Authority, referring to the submissions of F.E., found that the assembly planned by the applicant was also aimed at a confrontation with Comradeship IV and concluded that its prohibition was necessary for the maintenance of public order and for the protection of the Comradeship IV commemoration ceremony.\n\nOn 13 December 2000 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) dismissed a complaint by the applicant alleging violations of his rights to freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of religion and non-discrimination.\n\nThe Constitutional Court observed that the authorities deciding on the prohibition of an assembly had to weigh the applicant’s interest in holding the meeting against the public interests enumerated in Article 11 § 2 of the Convention. It went on to say that the prohibition of the proposed meeting would not be justified if its sole purpose were to protect the Comradeship IV commemoration ceremony and expressed doubts as to the authorities’ assessment that the latter meeting was a popular ceremony within the meaning of section 5 of the Assembly Act and therefore did not require authorisation. Nevertheless, the prohibition of the meeting proposed by the applicant was justified for other reasons.\n\nThe authorities had also had regard to the fact that the gathering of Comradeship IV had in previous years been the target of activities aimed at disrupting it which had caused considerable nuisance to other visitors of the cemetery and had each time required police intervention. The authorities had therefore correctly assumed that the prohibition of the assembly planned by the applicant was necessary to protect the general public against potential disturbances.\n\nThe Constitutional Court added further considerations in support of that conclusion. It observed that All Saints’ Day was an important religious holiday on which the population traditionally visited cemeteries in order to commemorate the dead. As a religious tradition, the commemoration of the dead was protected by Article 9 of the Convention, which contained a positive obligation for the State to protect persons manifesting their religion against deliberate disturbance by others. Thus, the prohibition of the assembly in issue was necessary under Article 11 § 2 of the Convention for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Kornaś-Pierzak, a lawyer practising in Cracow. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, inter alia, that the lustration proceedings in his case had been unfair, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 25 February 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Stronie Śląskie.\n\nOn 3 August 1997 the Law of 11 April 1997 on disclosing work for or service in the State’s security services or collaboration with them between 1944 and 1990 by persons exercising public functions (ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub służby w organach bezpieczeństwa państwa lub współpracy z nimi w latach 1944-1990 osób pełniących funkcje publiczne) (the “1997 Lustration Act”) entered into force.\n\nOn 14 April 2004 the applicant, a candidate for the European Parliament, declared that he had not collaborated with the communist-era secret services. He was subsequently elected as a Member of the European Parliament.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) decided to institute lustration proceedings against the applicant following a request made by the Commissioner of the Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego) on the grounds that the applicant had lied in his lustration declaration by denying that he had cooperated with the secret services.\n\nOn 17 February 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the first‑instance lustration court, found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration since he had been an intentional and secret collaborator with the State’s secret services. The court established that the applicant had met on probably two occasions in 1973 with agents of the secret services and had agreed to help them as a consultant.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision. He submitted that he had never collaborated with the secret services and the meeting in question had been in connection with the preparation of an article. The applicant also referred to his subsequent activity in the “Solidarność” movement for which he had been persecuted and detained by the communist authorities. Subsequently, he was allowed to leave Poland and between 1985 and 1994 he was a deputy of the Polish Section of Radio Free Europe in Munich.\n\nOn 6 June 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the second‑instance lustration court, upheld the impugned judgment.\n\nOn 1 February 2007 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-65369", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29544/95) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Mr Helmut Entleitner (“the applicant”), on 27 September 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Erich Prokskch, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Franz Cede, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that, in proceedings concerning a share of an agricultural association, the agricultural authorities lacked independence and impartiality and that he did not have any public hearing.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted in accordance with Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 12 October 1999 the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a farmer living in Piesendorf, Salzburg.\n\nOn 12 June 1991 the applicant applied to the Salzburg District Agricultural Authority (Agrarbezirksbehörde, the “District Authority“) for declarations (1) that the share in an agricultural association (Agrargemeinschaft) represented by a certain parcel of land (“the share“) belonged to him, and (2) that grazing rights in that parcel (“the grazing rights“) also belonged to him. On 24 June 1991 the District Authority found that the applicant had not made out his claims, and it declared that the share and the grazing rights belonged to a third person. The applicant appealed to the Regional Land Reform Board (Landesagrarsenat, the “Regional Board“).\n\nThe Regional Board dismissed the applicant's appeal on 8 May 1992. After an oral hearing, it found, so far as relevant, that the share had passed with a transfer of the land to a third party in 1949 (as rectified in 1952). The question of the grazing rights had to be determined by reference to the ownership of the land on 29 April 1868, as that was the last time they were officially mentioned. In the absence of any express alienation of the grazing rights since then, the grazing rights passed with the land - that is, the applicant did not own them.\n\nThe Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) declined to deal with the applicant's constitutional complaint on 14 October 1992. It remitted the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof).\n\nOn 14 March 1995 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint rejecting at the same time, in accordance with section 39(2) no. 6 of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz), the applicant’s request for an oral hearing.

Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the remainder of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1950 and lives in the district of Kuşadası in the province of Aydın.\n\nOn 9 June 1989 the Kuşadası District Council (hereinafter “the Council”) and the applicant signed an agreement. By virtue of this agreement the Council unconditionally allocated part of the historic castle in Kuşadası to the applicant to open and run a museum for an indefinite period. On 18 July 1989 the applicant was issued with a special title deed to the property enabling him to open the museum.\n\nOn 26 May 1990 the museum was opened to the public following the grant of a licence by the Ministry of Culture.\n\nOn 22 April 1991 the Council annulled the agreement of 9 June 1989 on the ground that the applicant had not signed a protocol with the Mayor of Kuşadası within 15 days from the date of the opening of the museum. Pursuant to such a protocol the applicant would have undertaken to pay the Council 40% of the money generated from the sale of the entrance tickets to visitors to the museum. Items displayed in the museum were removed from the museum by the Council's employees.\n\nOn 27 June 1991 the applicant brought an action before the Aydın Administrative Court requesting the annulment of the Council's decision of 22 April 1991.\n\nOn 12 November 1991 the Aydın Administrative Court annulled the decision on the ground that the Council had never informed the applicant about the protocol or warned him about its intention to rescind the agreement. The Council appealed against the decision.\n\nOn 2 May 1995 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the Aydın Administrative Court's decision of 12 November 1991.\n\nOn 28 September 1995 the Aydın Administrative Court acceded to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision and rejected the applicant's request to annul the Council's decision. The court noted that a clause in the initial agreement between the Council and the applicant had stipulated that 40% of the income would be handed over to the Council. The court further observed that the applicant had been reminded by the Council about this clause on 24 May 1990 and had been urged to sign the protocol.\n\nOn 27 February 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the applicant's appeal.\n\nOn 3 April 1997 the applicant applied to the Supreme Administrative Court and requested the rectification of the latter's decision of 27 February 1997.\n\nOn 23 December 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant's request for rectification.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Nuri Özkan - Turkish national applicant, born in 1950, lives in Kuşadası district of Aydın province, signed agreement with Council to run museum in historic castle", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Nuri Özkan", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "74-75", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Kuşadası / Aydın / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Museum operator", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "The Mayor of Kuşadası - Mayor mentioned in relation to protocol that applicant was supposed to sign within 15 days of museum opening", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Kuşadası / Aydın / Türkiye", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Mayor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Kuşadası Municipality", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Mayor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}]}

The applicant was represented by Ms B. Baysal, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 18 June 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Bartın.\n\nOn 13 January 1982 the applicant, a primary school teacher in Kahramanmaraş at the material time, was discharged from his duties and on 10 March 1989 he was reinstated.\n\nThe applicant subsequently requested the Ministry of Education (“the Ministry”) to reimburse him for the salaries and other financial rights he had been unfairly deprived of during the period of inactivity. The Ministry rejected this request.\n\nThe applicant lodged an action before the Ankara Administrative Court, requesting this court to quash the Ministry's decision and to order the payment of his entitlements.\n\nOn 6 November 1991 the Ankara Administrative Court partially granted the applicant's request and ordered the calculation and payment of the applicant's salaries and other financial benefits, solely for the period falling between 15 March 1985 and 10 March 1989. The administrative court did not order payment of interest on the relevant amount.\n\nOn 16 April 1992 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court.\n\nFollowing the final decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the applicant petitioned the Ministry on numerous occasions for the execution of the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court and the payment of his money.\n\nOn 14 January 2001 the applicant applied to the Ankara Administrative Court, requesting the clarification (tavzih) of its decision dated 6 November 1991. The applicant asked the court to declare, in particular, the exact amount that he was entitled to receive from the Ministry. He explained that without this information, he could not request the enforcement of the impugned judgment by execution offices.\n\nOn 20 March 2002 the Ankara Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request for clarification.\n\nOn 30 June 2005 the applicant was paid 4.35 Turkish liras (TRY0)0, which corresponded to the salaries and other financial benefits he would have received during the specified period of his discharge. The applicant was not paid any default interest on this amount to compensate the effects of inflation, pursuant to the instructions of the Ministry of Finance dated 24 May 2005 and the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court dated 6 November 1991.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Osman Erden - Turkish national applicant, born in 1960, lives in Bartın, former primary school teacher in Kahramanmaraş who was discharged in 1982 and reinstated in 1989", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Osman Erden", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "64-65", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Bartın / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Retired teacher", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Ministry of Education", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Primary school teacher", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms B.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-6b4b4", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an applications (nos. 265/07) against the Kingdom of Norway lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Louis Osaze Darren Omoregie, a Nigerian national; Mrs Elisabeth Skundberg Darren, a Norwegian national; and their daughter Selma, a Norwegian national (“the applicants”), on 13 December 2006.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr A. Humlen, a lawyer practising in Oslo. The Norwegian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs F. Platou Amble, Attorney, Attorney-General's Office (Civil Matters).\n\nThe applicants alleged that the decision to expel the first applicant to Nigeria with a prohibition of re-entry into Norway for a period of five years constituted a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nBy a decision of 22 November 2007, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first applicant, Mr Louis Osaze Darren Omoregie, is a Nigerian national who was born in Sierra Leone in 1979. The second applicant is Mrs Elisabeth Skundberg Darren, a Norwegian national who was born in 1977. The third applicant is their daughter, Selma, who was born on 20 September 2006. The second and third applicants reside in Biri, Norway, as did the first applicant, before he was expelled to Nigeria on 7 March 2007.\n\nThe first applicant lived in Nigeria as from the age of 6 months until he went to Norway, where he arrived on 25 August 2001, without passport or other identity document. On the same date he applied for asylum.\n\nIn October 2001 he met the second applicant. The couple started cohabiting in March 2002.\n\nA. Rejection of the first applicant's asylum application and related expulsion order and refusals\n\nThe first applicant's asylum application was rejected by the Directorate of Immigration on 22 May 2002. He appealed to the Immigration Appeals Board and, pending a decision of his appeal, he was granted a stay of execution of his expulsion and a temporary work permit.\n\nThe first and second applicants got engaged on 10 September 2002. On 11 September 2002 the Immigration Appeals Board rejected the applicant's appeal, stating inter alia “This administrative decision means that the appellant is obliged to leave the country voluntarily. If the appellant does not leave the country voluntarily, the police shall implement the decision; see sections 40 and 41 of the Immigration Act.”\n\nShortly thereafter the Implementation Group of the Oslo Police District sent a notification of the decision to the first applicant's lawyer, giving the first applicant until 30 September 2002 to leave Norway. The notification further stated: “Your client must contact the Implementation Group for Administrative Decisions as soon as possible to make arrangements for his departure from Norway. If we have not been contacted by the time the deadline expires, the decision will be implemented in accordance with section 41 of the Immigration Act. This could result in his arrest without further notice.”\n\nOn 1 October 2002 the first applicant requested the Board to stay his expulsion, which the Board refused on 7 October 2002.\n\nNo judicial appeal was lodged against the above decisions, which became final.\n\nOn 2 February 2003 the first and second applicants got married.\n\nOn 14 February 2003 the first applicant applied for a work permit on the ground of family reunification. The Directorate of Immigration rejected the application on 26 April 2003 and ordered him to leave Norway while indicating that the decision could be appealed against and that the police could set a time-limit for asking for respite of the expulsion. The decision was notified to him by local police on 7 May 2003 with an order to leave the country by 4 June 2003. The Directorate considered that the first applicant fell within a group of persons who were granted work permit for the purpose of family reunification under section 9 of the Immigration Act (and Article 23(1)(a) of the Immigration Regulation (Utlendingsforskriften)) but rejected the application on the ground that it was not documented that he had fulfilled the condition of ensured means of subsistence (Article 25 of the Regulation). In the view of the Directorate, there were no particularly strong human considerations warranting an exception being made from this condition in the instant case (Article 25(3)).\n\nOn 14 May 2003 the first applicant again appealed and requested stay of execution. The Directorate of Immigration rejected the request and local police notified him thereof on 19 October 2003 with an order to leave Norway by 30 October 2003.\n\nB. Administrative sanction for failure to leave the country and ensuing judicial proceedings\n\nConcurrently with the Immigration Appeals Board's examination of the first applicant's appeal of 14 May 2003, the Directorate of Immigration on 4 July 2003 warned him that it was contemplating to expel him pursuant to section 29(1)(a) of the Immigration Act. It referred to his registered gainful employment since 1 September 2002 and to his having worked in breach of section 6 of the Immigration Act since the rejection of his asylum application on 11 September 2002. Moreover, the Directorate referred to his defiance of his obligation to comply with the time-limit for leaving the country after the rejection of his asylum request. The Directorate considered that he had seriously contravened the provisions of the Act and had evaded implementation of the order to leave the country.\n\nOn 26 August 2003 the Directorate of Immigration decided to expel the applicant pursuant section 29(1)(a) of the Immigration Act. It found that the applicant's alleged ignorance of the unlawfulness of his gainful occupation was no excuse and that it would not be disproportionate to expel him despite his marriage with the second applicant. It decided to prohibit the first applicant from re-entry into Norway for five years, with a possibility of re-entry on application - normally only after two years.\n\nOn 21 July 2004 the Immigration Appeals Board upheld the Directorate of Immigration's rejection of his request for family reunification and its decision that the basic conditions for expelling the first applicant under section 29(1) of the Immigration Act were fulfilled; for more than a year he had been in gainful occupation without a work/residence permit. The Board also noted that he had avoided the implementation of the decision refusing him asylum and obliging him to leave the country. The Board found that his expulsion would not be disproportionate or otherwise contrary to Article 8 of the Convention. It also dismissed his appeal against the Directorate's rejection of his application for a work permit.\n\nBy a judgment of 15 February 2005 the Oslo City Court quashed the Immigration Appeals Board's decision of 21 July 2004 as being invalid.\n\nIn its judgment the City Court observed that it found it obvious that the basic condition for expelling the first applicant – that he had seriously or repeatedly violated the Immigration Act or had defied implementation of the decision that he should leave the country – had been fulfilled. The question then was whether expulsion would be a disproportionate measure vis-à-vis the first applicant and his close family.\n\nIn this regard the City Court observed that, although the first applicant had failed to comply with one of the conditions for contracting marriage in Norway, namely lawful residence in the country (sections 5(a) and 7 (k) of the Marriage Act 1991), he had had reason to believe (as from February 2003) that he had a right to stay and to apply for a work permit and a residence permit. While he had failed to respect two time-limits for leaving the country (30 September 2002 and 4 June 2003), he could not be criticised for having exceeded such deadlines after 26 April 2003 as the information furnished to him by the Directorate of Immigration had been unclear as to the time-limits set for his leaving the country compared to those set for asking respite and the replies given to his requests for respite. He had worked unlawfully for nine months and had resided unlawfully for four and a half months. This was, relatively speaking, not a very serious offence, which fact counterbalanced his relatively weak links to Norway. To impose a prohibition on re-entry for five years would constitute a disproportionate measure towards the applicant and his family in the sense of section 29 of the Immigration Act. It could easily lead to the dissolution of the family. The second applicant would presumably have great difficulties of adaptation in the first applicant's home country. Even if the first applicant could apply for re-entry after two years, he would most probably only be granted permission to come for shorter visits. The City Court found it unnecessary to examine whether the disputed decision violated Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn an appeal by the State against the City Court judgment, the High Court reached a different conclusion. By a judgment of 27 February 2006, it found that the first applicant's omission to leave the country voluntarily, although not the same as going under ground, meant that he had avoided compliance with the order to leave the country, meaning that the basic conditions for his expulsion under section 29 of the Immigration Act were fulfilled.\n\nThe High Court noted from the outset that the first applicant had acknowledged that he had seriously or repeatedly infringed the provisions of the Immigration Act and that the formal conditions for expulsion were fulfilled. The first applicant disputed that he had evaded a decision to leave the country and had only omitted to voluntarily comply with the decision. However, the High Court considered that also such an omission constituted evasion for the purposes of the act, although it was less serious than going under ground.\n\nThe High Court found it established that the applicant had stayed lawfully in Norway from 25 August 2001 to 30 September 2002. It was undisputed that his stay was unlawful from 30 September or 1 October 2002 until 14 February 2003 when he applied for family reunification. It was further undisputed that he had worked unlawfully without a work permit for 9 months, from 30 September/1 October 2002 until early July 2003, when the Directorate of Immigration warned him about expulsion. Thus the formal grounds for expulsion according to section 29 of the Immigration Act (as defined in Circular 03-25) were fulfilled.\n\nThe High Court observed that the central issue was the one of proportionality. In this regard it noted that the first applicant's links to Norway were very limited. He had arrived in Norway aged 22 years, without any links to the country. At the time of the impugned decision he had lived there for less than three years, parts of the time unlawfully. Already after less than two years he had been warned of expulsion. His stay in Norway had been very short and could not have given him any legitimate expectation of being able to live there. This was not significantly altered by his marriage to the second applicant, which had been entered into shortly before the disputed decision and in breach of the provisions on marriage. It was not uncommon for a person whose expulsion had been decided to marry a Norwegian citizen and use this as an argument to have the expulsion order invalidated. In such a situation expulsion would inevitably interfere with an established family situation. In this case there was no indication that expulsion would entail extra burdens of any kind beyond what followed from the separation.\n\nThe High Court also found that the first applicant's links to Nigeria were particularly strong and far more so than his links to Norway. In Nigeria he had lived from the age of six months until the age of 22, had studied at university for four years, and had three brothers with whom he was still in contact. Nor were there any concrete factors suggesting that, because he sought asylum in Norway, he would encounter particular problems with the Nigerian authorities upon return.\n\nAs regards the second applicant, the High Court observed that at the time that they married she must already have been aware of the uncertainty of the first applicant's stay in Norway. Moreover, she was used to living abroad, having lived for several periods in South Africa. English was also the official language of Nigeria. In the view of the High Court, she would not face insurmountable problems by settling in Nigeria for a shorter or longer period, should she so wish.\n\nAs to the first applicant's violations of the Immigration Act, the High Court found them to be of a certain degree of seriousness but did not find them particularly aggravated. However, having regard to the tenuous character of his links to Norway, the High Court considered that the balance of interest was not in his favour. Were it to be otherwise, expulsion would be possible only in very rare cases, with the consequence that this would have for the implementation of adopted immigration policies. The only countervailing consideration was his marriage to the second applicant. However, this could not be decisive; otherwise it would leave open a practice which would completely undermine the authorities' implementation of the Immigration Act.\n\nRelying essentially on the same considerations as mentioned above, the High Court, taking into account the Strasbourg Court's case law, did not find that the disputed decision would be incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 14 June 2006 the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal, finding it obvious that the appeal had no prospects of success.\n\nIn the meantime, on 15 February 2005 the first applicant had submitted a new application for a work permit on the ground of family reunification with the second applicant. The Directorate of Immigration rejected his application on 21 July 2006.\n\nC. Birth of the third applicant and renewed requests by the first applicant\n\nOn 20 September 2006 the couple had a child, Selma, who is the third applicant.\n\nOn 31 October 2006 the Immigration Appeals Board rejected an appeal by the first applicant against the Directorate of Immigration's refusal of 21 July 2006. The Board found that quashing the refusal of re-entry was not required in the interest of the third applicant, inter alia noting that the child had been conceived after a final expulsion order and referring to the circumstances of the entry into marriage. It would be possible for the second and third applicants to live with the first applicant for shorter or longer periods in his home country. Although the fact that the first and second applicants had had a child together substantially altered the assessment of the proportionality of the prohibition of re-entry, the Board still did not find that the measure would be disproportionate. Neither Article 8 of the Convention nor the United Nations Children Convention could imply a different solution.\n\nOn 2 November 2006 the Directorate of Immigration refused to stay the applicant's expulsion.\n\nOn 13 December 2006 the applicants, represented by a lawyer, submitted an application under the Convention, which was received at the Registry on 3 January 2007. They complained that the first applicant's expulsion would entail a splitting of the family in breach of Article 8 of the Convention. It would not be possible for the second and third applicants to accompany him to Nigeria. They submitted that, having regard to the minor character of his breaches of the Immigration Act, the enforcement of the expulsion order would constitute a disproportionate interference with the applicant's family life. Any such enforcement should await a final decision by the Court.\n\nOn 5 January 2007 the President of the Section decided, in the circumstances, not to indicate to the Government of Norway, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the interim measure requested. The circumstances underlying the application were not of the kind to which, in the Court's practice, Rule 39 was applied. On 19 January 2007 the applicants' lawyer informed the Court that they wished to maintain their application notwithstanding the refusal to apply Rule 39.\n\nOn 30 March 2007 the Immigration Appeals Board dismissed an appeal by the first applicant against a rejection by the Directorate of Immigration of 30 October 2006 of a renewed request by the first applicant for family reunion with the third applicant. The request had been made on the basis of a provision in the Immigration Regulation which was applicable to cases of unmarried parents and therefore did not cover the applicants' case. Nor did the Board see any other reason for altering its earlier decision in the case.\n\nD. Implementation of the first applicant's expulsion\n\nIn the meantime, on 7 March 2007 the Implementation Group of the Oslo Police District expelled the first applicant back to Nigeria.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Louis Osaze Darren Omoregie - First applicant, Nigerian national born in Sierra Leone in 1979, expelled to Nigeria", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Louis Osaze Darren Omoregie", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "45-46", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Nigeria", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Nigeria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mrs Elisabeth Skundberg Darren - Second applicant, Norwegian national born in 1977, wife of first applicant", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Elisabeth Skundberg Darren", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "47-48", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Biri / Norway", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Norway", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "Selma - Third applicant, daughter of first and second applicants, Norwegian national born on 20 September 2006", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Selma", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "18", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Biri / Norway", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Norway", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "In Highschool", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "No relation", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 3, "description": "Mr A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-33118", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 77746/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs Waleria Kroenitz (“the applicant”), on 28 July 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The applicant was exceptionally granted leave to be represented by Mr Cz. Sławski (Rule 36 § 4 of the Rules of Court). The latter was also granted leave to use the Polish language in the proceedings before the Court (Rule 34 § 3 of the Rules of Court).\n\nThe applicant alleged in particular, that her right to a “hearing within reasonable time” had not been respected.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. On 30 April the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings and an alleged interference with the applicant’s property rights to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. It also gave priority to application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant, Mrs Waleria Kroenitz, is a Polish national, who was born in 1903 and lives in Przemyśl, Poland.\n\nA. Proceedings concerning a claim for restitution and compensation.\n\nIn 1948 the applicant’s property was expropriated. On 28 June 1996 the Minister of Economy (Minister Gospodarki) annulled the expropriation order.\n\nOn 23 December 1996 the applicant brought a claim against a company “Domgos” (Częstochowskie Zakłady Metalowe “Domgos”) before the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki), seeking restitution of her property. The court held hearings on 30 May, 10 July and 17 October 1997.\n\nOn 30 January 1998 the applicant modified her claim and filed an action for compensation for loss of profits caused by the prolonged impossibility of using her property.\n\nOn 8 March 1999 the Częstochowa Regional Court held a hearing and gave an interlocutory judgment. It ordered that the property be restored to the applicant.\n\nOn 9 December 1999 the court was to hold a hearing, but an expert failed to appear because he had not been duly summoned. On 27 January 2000 and 23 March 2000 the court held further hearings.\n\nA hearing listed for 15 February 2001 was cancelled since the expert and the defendant failed to appear.\n\nThe hearing listed for 29 March 2001 was adjourned as the court had ordered the expert to prepare a supplementary report. On 21 February 2002 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 8 March 2002 the Regional Court gave judgment and awarded the applicant compensation. Following the defendant’s appeal, the proceedings are pending before the Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny).\n\nB. Proceedings concerning a claim for compensation against the State Treasury.\n\nOn 26 April 1998 the applicant asked the Minister of Economy to award her compensation. On 22 May 1998 the Minister dismissed her request.\n\nOn 24 June 1998 the applicant filed with the Warsaw Regional Court an action for compensation against the State Treasury the Minister of Economy. The court held hearings on 19 November 1999 and 22 September 2000.\n\nOn 22 September 2000 the court gave judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 24 January and 7 March 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) held hearings. On the latter date the court gave judgment. The applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mrs Waleria Kroenitz - Polish national applicant, born in 1903, lives in Przemyśl, Poland, whose property was expropriated in 1948 and who filed claims for restitution and compensation", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Waleria Kroenitz", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "121-122", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Przemyśl / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 1, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr K.

Wojtunik (“the applicant”).\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr. J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 28 October 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nA. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Świnoujście.\n\nOn 1 December 1992 the applicant brought an action against his former employer before the Szczecin Regional Court for payment of 88,674 zlotys in compensation for refraining from undertaking any professional activity in competition to that of his former employer. His contract of employment provided for such compensation for a period of six months after the termination of his contract of employment (“the competition clause”).\n\nHearings were held on 3 March 1993, 27 August 1993 and 26 October 1993. On 26 October 1993 the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. The applicant appealed to the Poznań Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 24 March 1994 an appeal hearing was held.\n\nOn 5 May 1994 the Poznań Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 20 December 1994 a hearing was held during which the court examined witnesses.\n\nOn 7 February 1995, 4 April 1995 and 16 May 1995 further hearings were held. On 16 May 1995 the court decided to have witnesses examined by other courts for reasons of economy of proceedings. It sent its request to these courts on 27 July 1995. On 12 October 1995 and 10 December 1995 the requested courts examined witnesses.\n\nOn 6 February 1996, 18 March 1996 and 19 November 1996 further hearings were held.\n\nOn 29 January 1997 the Szczecin Regional Court gave a judgment in which it allowed the applicant’s claim in part – it awarded him 44,621 zlotys. Both parties appealed.\n\nOn 31 July 1997 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s action in its entirety. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal.\n\nOn 24 February 1998 the Supreme Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 22 October 1998 a hearing was held before the Poznań Court of Appeal during which the parties agreed to enter into negotiations.\n\nOn 28 January 1999 a judicial settlement was concluded and the proceedings were discontinued. According to the settlement, the applicant obtained 61,000 zlotys.\n\nB. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE 0\n\nOn 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki - “the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act.\n\nOn 18 January 2005 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Law produced legal effects as from the date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date but only when they had not yet been remedied.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr. M.

It originated in an application (no. 30428/96) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 by the applicant. The Government of Austria are represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant’s request to the Court referred to Article 48 as amended by Protocol No. 9, which Austria had ratified. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 July 1999 the Panel of the Grand Chamber decided, pursuant to Article 5 § 4 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention and Rules 100 § 1 and 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, that the application would be examined by one of the Sections. It was, thereupon, assigned to the Third Section. Within that Section, the Chamber was constituted in accordance with Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 59 § 3 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues of the case. The applicant submitted such a memorial on 2 September 1999, the Government on 29 October 1999.\n\nAfter consulting the Agent of the Government and the applicant, the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing in the case.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 2 December 1994 the applicant filed an action with the Vienna Labour and Social Court (Arbeits- und Sozialgericht) against her employer, the General Accident Insurance Company (Allgemeine Unfallversicherungsanstalt). She requested the Court to order her employer to annul her transfer from one department of the hospital where she was working as a nurse to another department.\n\nOn 15 May 1995 the Social and Labour Court granted the applicant's action by a judgment in default (Versäumungsurteil) and ordered the defendant to reimburse the applicant's costs, i.e. 33,658 Austrian Schillings (ATS).\n\nOn 31 May 1995 the General Accident Insurance Company filed an appeal against the costs order (Kostenrekurs). It submitted that the costs had not been calculated correctly under the Act on Lawyers' Fees (Rechtsanwaltstarifgesetz) and requested their reduction. This appeal was not transmitted to the applicant.\n\nOn 19 July 1995 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), sitting in camera, granted the appeal, recalculated the costs to be reimbursed and reduced them to ATS 14,754.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mrs Gertrude Beer - The applicant, Austrian national who filed the case against Austria, worked as a nurse and filed action against her employer regarding transfer between hospital departments", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Gertrude Beer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Vienna / Austria", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Austria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 1, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Nurse", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "General Accident Insurance Company", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ambassador H.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-17ea4", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35354/04) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Dr. Heidemarie Abrahamian (“the applicant”), on 20 September 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr G. Witt, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the Administrative Court had failed to hold an oral hearing on her complaint to that court.\n\nOn 2 May 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a medical practitioner, employed by a public hospital in Vienna and has also a private surgery. She is a member of the Vienna Medical Association (Ärztekammer), a public law body established under the Medical Practitioner’s Act (Ärztegesetz) with compulsory membership. As a member of that association she is also compulsory affiliated to the pension and invalidity fund (Wohlfahrtsfonds) of that Medical Association under the relevant provisions of the Medical Practitioner’s Act.\n\nOn 28 April 2000 the Administrative Committee (Verwaltungsausschuss) of the pension and invalidity fund issued an order against the applicant for payment of compulsory contributions for 1999. It applied the statutory rate of contribution of 15.8% as fixed in the statutes of the pension and invalidity fund.\n\nOn 9 May 2000 the applicant appealed. She submitted that the calculation was incorrect and that the obligation to pay contributions was unconstitutional.\n\nOn 20 July 2000 the Appeal Committee (Beschwerdeausschuss) of the Medical Association dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It stated that the calculation had been correct and that the other issues raised by the applicant were too general or outside the competence of the Appeal Committee.\n\nOn 1 September 2000 the applicant filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court. She complained that the decision was arbitrary and breached her right to peaceful enjoyment of her property. She submitted that Section 112 of the Medical Practitioners Act, which allowed for exemption from the liability to pay contributions to the pension and invalidity fund, did not sufficiently allow for private initiatives in ensuring an adequate pension. Also the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act which provided for compulsory membership and compulsory affiliation to the pension and invalidity fund were in breach of EU-law and a preliminary ruling on that issue should be obtained by the European Court. On 22 May 2002 she supplemented her complaint.\n\nOn 26 June 2002 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the applicant’s complaint for lack of prospect of success. It stated that, at the most, questions of ordinary law could arise in the applicant’s case, but no issues of constitutional law or the law of the European Union. Insofar as the applicant had alleged that the ordinary law applied by the administrative authorities was unconstitutional, the Constitutional Court, referring to its case-law, considered this allegation unfounded.\n\nThe applicant filed a request for transfer of the case to the Administrative Court and, on 21 August 2002, the Constitutional Court did so.\n\nOn 8 January 2003 the Administrative Court invited the respondent authority to file observations, which it did on 25 January 2003. On 11 April 2003 the applicant replied.\n\nOn 23 May 2003 the Administrative Court quashed the appeal decision of 20 July 2000 and remitted the case back to the Appeal Committee. It found that on one point, namely as regards deductible expenses, the Appeal Committee’s decision had not been sufficiently reasoned.\n\nOn 15 October 2003 the Appeal Committee decided again, dismissing the appeal.\n\nOn 5 December 2003 the applicant filed a further complaint to the Administrative Court, she also requested that a public hearing be held and that suspensive effect be granted. However, at this stage of the proceedings the applicant failed to reiterate her request for referral to the European Court of Justice.\n\nOn 16 December 2003 the Administrative Court invited the respondent authority to file observations, which it did so on 6 February 2004.\n\nOn 15 March 2004 the applicant submitted further observations. In her further observations she reiterated her request to submit for a preliminary ruling to the European Court the question of the conformity of the compulsory affiliation to the pension and invalidity fund with EU-law.\n\nMeanwhile, on 27 February 2004 the Administrative Court had dismissed the applicant’s complaint without holding a public hearing. It found that the Appeal Committee had correctly calculated the amount of the applicant’s contributions. This decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 23 March 2004.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Dr. Heidemarie Abrahamian - Austrian national, medical practitioner employed by a public hospital in Vienna with private surgery, member of Vienna Medical Association, the applicant in this case", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Dr. Heidemarie Abrahamian", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Vienna / Austria", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Austria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "PhD", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Medical practitioner", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Public hospital in Vienna", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Doctor", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr G.

Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn 27 May 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nJudge Jaeger, the judge elected in respect of Germany, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). On 20 June 2008, the Government, pursuant to Rule 29 § 1 (a), informed the Court that they had appointed in her stead another elected judge, namely Judge Mark Villiger.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\n1. Background to the case\n\nThe applicant was born in 1923 and lives in Hamburg.\n\nFrom 1970 he practised as a physician affiliated to the statutory public health insurance scheme.\n\nIn 1992 the Health Care Reform Act (Gesundheitsstrukturgesetz) amended the relevant provisions of the Social Security Act, Book V (Sozialgesetzbuch V) and introduced a retirement age of 68 for those medical practitioners who were affiliated to the statutory public health insurance scheme with effect from 1 January 1999 (see “Relevant domestic law” below).\n\n2. Proceedings before the domestic authorities\n\nOn 11 May 1998 the Hamburg Regional Registration Committee for Physicians (Zulassungausschuss für Ärzte) decided that according to section 95 § 7 of the Social Security Act, Book V (see “Relevant domestic law” below) the applicant’s authorisation to practise as a physician under the statutory public health insurance scheme would expire on 1 January 1999 as the applicant already had reached his 68th birthday prior to that date.\n\nOn 27 July 1998 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal against that decision, which the Hamburg Appeals Board for Physicians (Berufungsausschuss) dismissed on 30 September 1998.\n\nOn 19 November 1998 the applicant brought an action before the Hamburg Social Court to have the previous decisions annulled without submitting his statement of claim.\n\nOn 21 December 1998 the applicant, without awaiting the outcome of the proceedings before the Social Court, lodged a constitutional complaint which the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit on 15 February 1999.\n\nOn 21 May 1999 the applicant submitted a statement of claim to the Hamburg Social Court which it forwarded to the defendant on 16 July 1999.\n\nOn 21 December 1999 the Social Court forwarded the defendant’s statement of 26 July 1999 to the applicant.\n\nOn 18 February 2000 the Social Court forwarded the defendant’s further statements of 18 January 2000 to the applicant and requested him to comment on them which the applicant did on 3 September 2001.\n\nBetween 21 September 2001 and 22 May 2002 the case file was erroneously stored in the Social Court’s archives.\n\nOn 17 October 2002 the Social Court informed the applicant that it intended to render a decision (Gerichtsbescheid) without holding an oral hearing and invited the applicant to submit written comments within one month. On 15 November 2002 the applicant submitted his comments.\n\nOn 20 August 2003 the Hamburg Social Court dismissed his action, referring to the established case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court according to which the introduction of a compulsory retirement age for doctors had been compatible with the Basic Law (Grundgesetz).\n\nOn 23 September 2003 the Social Court served that decision on the applicant.\n\n3. Proceedings before the Court\n\nOn 18 August 1999 the applicant lodged his first application with the Court, alleging that the revocation of his authorisation to practise as a physician under the statutory public health insurance scheme violated his rights under Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nOn 20 May 2003 the Court declared his application (no. 55004/00) inadmissible for being manifestly ill-founded.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Hans-Jürgen Deiwick - The applicant, German national born in 1923, lives in Hamburg, physician who practiced under statutory public health insurance scheme from 1970, lost authorization due to mandatory retirement age of 68", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Hans-Jürgen Deiwick", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "101-102", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Hamburg / Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Physician", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Statutory public health insurance scheme", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mrs A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-32887", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29851/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehdi Zana (“the applicant”), on 1 September 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Sezgin Tanrıkulu, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır (Turkey). The Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his conviction constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression and that he was denied a fair hearing on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Istanbul State Security Court.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 19 September 2000 the Chamber declared the applicant’s complaint under Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention inadmissible and retained his complaint under Article 6 § 1 for examination on the merits.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nOn 28 June 1992 the applicant participated in a meeting organised by a political party, the People’s Labour Party (Halkın Emek Partisi, HEP), in Bursa. At this meeting he made a speech on the Kurdish question.\n\nThe Chief Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant charging him with disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisibility of the State on account of his speech. The charges were brought under section 8 § 1 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (hereinafter “the 1991 Act”).\n\nIn the proceedings before the Istanbul State Security Court, the applicant denied the charges and requested his acquittal. He asserted that he had made this speech because he felt responsible for the Kurdish problem.\n\nIn a judgment dated 14 April 1994, the Istanbul State Security Court found the applicant guilty of an offence under section 8 § 1 of the 1991 Act. It sentenced the applicant to 2 years’ imprisonment and a fine of 100,000,000 Turkish Liras (TRL). The court held that the following phrases in the applicant’s speech contravened section 8 of the 1991 Act: “... We know how to die for our cause and we do even die...O Kurds! join hands, give a martyr every day... we will maintain our cause until we achieve it... we are going to stop this oppression and we are going to get our rights with our fists... if the present Government do not say ‘stop’ to this oppression, we are going to stop it... we have taken an oath not to withdraw, even if only a single warrior remains... Kurdistan is seen on the horizon...”\n\nThe Istanbul State Security Court considered that the incriminated speech, taken as a whole, amounted to propaganda, including violence, against the indivisible integrity of the State. The court found that the applicant had alleged that the State was guilty of oppression and the infliction of torture. It held that this allegation constituted a clear and present danger since the applicant had given incorrect information about the incidents and the Government’s policies in the south-east. The applicant appealed against his conviction.\n\nOn 31 January 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the Istanbul State Security Court’s judgment. The applicant learned of this decision in July 1995 while he was in prison.\n\nFollowing the amendments made by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act, the Istanbul State Security Court ex officio re‑examined the applicant’s case. On 16 February 1996 the court confirmed the applicant’s conviction, but reduced the sentence imposed on the applicant. It finally sentenced the applicant to 1 year’s imprisonment and a fine of 100,000,000 TRL. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 12 January 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal, upholding the State Security Court’s reasoning and its assessment of the evidence.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Mehdi Zana -

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-3c5d3", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39412/08) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Zbigniew Ściebura (“the applicant”), on 4 August 2008.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Burda, a lawyer practising in Cracow. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention on remand in exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, which amounted to interference with his private and family life.\n\nOn 12 October 2009 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Cracow.\n\nOn 14 January 1999 criminal charges were brought against the applicant. He was suspected of armed robberies, committed in an organised criminal group. The applicant was in hiding at the material time.\n\nOn 29 January 1999 an arrest warrant was issued against the applicant by the Polish authorities. After having been unsuccessfully sought for many months, he was eventually detained in Spain on 23 October 2001 and remanded in custody.\n\nSubsequently, action was taken with a view to the applicant's extradition and on 21 October 2002, the Spanish authorities handed him over to Poland.\n\nOn 24 October 2002 the Katowice District Court ordered that the applicant remain in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. The court considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence and induce witnesses to give false testimony or go underground again (he had earlier been in hiding in Spain). It further stressed the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fact that the applicant had been acting in an organised criminal group.\n\nThe applicant's appeal against the detention order was dismissed by the Katowice Regional Court on 23 December 2002. Likewise, his further appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent, numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him were unsuccessful. In his applications and appeals he relied on his personal circumstances, in particular his poor health, stressing that he had been infected with an HCV virus.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the applicant's detention was prolonged on several occasions, namely by the Katowice Regional Court's decisions of 16 January, 20 March and 8 September 2003, 16 January and 20 September 2004, 14 January, 6 June and 14 November 2005, 24 April and 20 October 2006 and the Katowice Court of Appeal's decisions of 8 August 2007 and 6 February 2008. In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant's detention. In addition, they stressed the existence of a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question, which was supported by an extensive body of evidence from witnesses and experts. Further, they attached importance to the grave nature of the charges against him and the fact that a “wanted” notice had been issued for his arrest.\n\nOn 3 March 2003 the Regional Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Częstochowa Regional Court. The applicant was charged with inter alia numerous counts of armed robberies committed in an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 27 March 2003 the Częstochowa Regional Court requested the Supreme Court that the case be transferred to the Katowice Regional Court. The court stressed the special nature of the case, which implied that exceptional security measures be taken and special facilities provided. On 14 May 2003 the Supreme Court granted the request.\n\nBetween 18 November 2002 and 16 September 2005 the applicant served a prison sentence imposed in another set of criminal proceedings (on the strength of the Cracow District Court's judgment of 23 February 1998).\n\nOn 14 April 2008 the Katowice Regional Court granted the applicant's request to be released on bail. On 16 April 2008 the applicant was released as he had paid bail of 350,000 Polish zlotys (PLN).\n\nIt appears that the criminal proceedings are still pending.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Zbigniew Ściebura - Polish national applicant, born in 1971, lives in Cracow, charged with armed robberies in organized criminal group", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Zbigniew Ściebura", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "53-54", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Cracow / Poland", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr M.

Clerides, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had prevented him from having access to his home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 8 June 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b)).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant claimed that until July 1974 he used to live with his family in a house belonging to his parents in Lapithos, a village in the District of Kyrenia. In July 1974, as the Turkish army was advancing, the applicant and his family had been forced to leave Lapithos. Ever since, they have not been able to return to the applicant’s parents’ house.\n\nOn 20 April 1990 the applicant’s parents donated half of their house to the applicant. They also donated to him half of three other houses, two shops and a number of plots of land and water installations in Lapithos. The remaining half of the properties mentioned above was transferred to the applicant’s sister. The transfers at issue were recorded in the Land Registry of the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nThe applicant produced the relevant affirmations of ownership issued by the Republic of Cyprus. According to these documents, the applicant’s properties could be described as follows: (a) plot no. 288/3, sheet/plan 11/14 E.1, plot of land – olive grove, area 2,282 sq. m; (b) plots nos. 511 and 513, sheet/plan 11/14E.2, plots of land, area: 3,862 sq. m and 3,405 sq. m respectively; (c) plots nos. 19, 20, 28 and 29, sheet/plan 11/15W.1, plots of land, area: 1,053 sq. m, 1,024 sq. m, 1,769 sq. m and 1,405 sq. m respectively; (d) plots nos. 98 and 128/1, sheet/plan 11/15W.2, lemon plantations, area: 5,219 sq. m and 1,469 sq. m respectively; (e) plot no. 296, sheet/plan 11/15W.2, lemon plantation with bore hole, area: 4,877 sq. m; (f) plots nos. 22, 22/1, 22/2, 22/3 and 22/4, sheet/plan 11/15W.2 and E.2, lemon plantation with two wells and one ground storey residence, area: 7,032 sq. m; (g) plot no. 42, sheet/plan 11/15W.2.E (no. 2), lemon plantation, area: 1,018 sq. m; (h) plot no. 104, sheet/plan 11/15W.2.E (no. 2), tank of an area of 37 sq. m with a freshwater spring; (i) plots nos. 60/1/2, 63/1 and 63/3, sheet/plan 11.23E.1,W (no. 1), lemon plantation (area: 2,358 sq. m) with a bore hole and one tank (area: 84 sq. m); on this property had been constructed: a ground storey residence of an area of 152.25 sq. m; two shops of an area of 56 sq. m; two semidetached ground storey residences (areas: 152.25 sq. m and 63 sq. m respectively); one residence of an area of 219.41 sq. m; (j) plots nos. 53, 773, 774, 775 and 776, sheet/plan 11/23W.2,E.1 and 11/23W1E (no. 2), right to use a freshwater spring.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus had prevented him from using and/or enjoying his properties.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Andreas Orphanides - Cypriot national applicant, born in 1955, lives in Nicosia, claims property rights in northern Cyprus that he cannot access due to Turkish occupation", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Andreas Orphanides", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "69-70", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Nicosia / Cyprus", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Cyprus", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr C.

Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Amasya.\n\nOn 9 June 1993 the applicant began working as a watchman at the Belevi Municipality, attached to the Taşova District in the province of Amasya. Under Turkish law, his employment status was that of a civil servant. On 8 June 1995, relying on three appraisal reports drafted in the past two years, the Municipality terminated the applicant’s employment contract.\n\nOn 12 June 1995 the applicant initiated proceedings against the Municipality in the Samsun Administrative Court and contested the termination of his contract. Furthermore, he requested to be awarded his monthly salary, which was 7,630,000 Turkish Liras (TRL)0, together with the interest, for the period during which he was unemployed.\n\nOn 27 November 1996 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s request. He appealed and requested the suspension of the enforcement of the decision.\n\nBy an interim decision of 27 August 1997, the Supreme Administrative Court suspended the enforcement of the administrative court’s decision of 27 November 1996, as well as the Municipality’s decision to dismiss the applicant. The applicant resumed his work at the Municipality.\n\nOn 3 February 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court found that the Municipality had in fact dismissed several employees following the election of a new mayor. It was established that the Municipality had been relying on identical and stereotyped appraisal reports, which did not sufficiently reflect the reasons for their dismissal. Accordingly, the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the decision of the Samsun Administrative Court.\n\nOn 31 May 2000 the Samsun Administrative Court followed the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court and annulled the decision of the Municipality. The court further ordered that the applicant be reinstated in his job and that his monthly salary and related pecuniary rights be paid to him for the period during which he had been entitled to perform his duties.\n\nOn 13 December 2001 the Council of State rejected the appeal filed by the Municipality. This judgment was served on the applicant on 3 April 2002.\n\nTo date, the Municipality has not made any payment to the applicant.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Ahmet Kılıç - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1963, lives in Amasya, worked as a watchman at Belevi Municipality starting June 1993, employment terminated in 1995", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Ahmet Kılıç", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "61-62", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Amasya / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr H.

Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 3 July 2001 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nA. Facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nIn 1989 the applicant, a lorry driver, was involved in a traffic accident. As a result of that accident he sustained serious head injuries. Subsequently, he was granted a disability pension.\n\nIn 1991 a criminal court acquitted the applicant of breaching traffic regulations and established that the accident had been caused by a defective road surface.\n\nOn 15 May 1992 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) an action for damages against the State Treasury – the Kielce Regional Directorate of State Roads (Dyrekcja Okręgowa Dróg Publicznych) and the State Insurance Company (PZU S.A).\n\nOn 29 September 1992 the court decided to transfer the case to the Kielce Regional Court. On 30 October 1992, upon the applicant’s appeal, the Warsaw Regional Court quashed the decision of 29 September 1992.\n\nA hearing listed for 16 April 1993 was adjourned.\n\nB. Facts after 30 April 1993\n\nA hearing scheduled for 18 June 1993 was adjourned at the request of the defendants.\n\nSubsequently, on 28 September 1993 the court held a hearing at which it heard the applicant.\n\nOn 23 November 1993 the Busko-Zdrój District Court, at the trial court’s request, heard certain witnesses.\n\nOn 11 February 1994 the trial court held a hearing at which the parties applied to adduce new evidence. Upon the defendants’ application the court adjourned the hearing sine die.\n\nOn 14 February 1995 the court ordered an expert opinion. In June 1995 the opinion was submitted to the court.\n\nBetween 12 February 1994 and 4 February 1996 no hearings were held.\n\nSubsequently, hearings were held on 5 February 1996, 13 May 1997 and 5 January 1998 at which the court heard expert witnesses and ordered new expert opinions.\n\nAt the hearing held on 3 April 1998 the court joined as co-defendant a certain road works company.\n\nOn 8 June, 10 September and 15 December 1998 the court held hearings. All of them were adjourned at the request of the defendants or because of the absence of witnesses.\n\nOn 14 January 1999, at the trial court’s request, the Kielce District Court heard a witness.\n\nSubsequently, the trial court held hearings on 8 February and 1 April 1999.\n\nOn 23 September 1999 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment. It awarded the applicant non-pecuniary damages and a monthly allowance to be paid by the State Treasury – the Regional Directorate of State Roads. The court dismissed the applicant’s claims in respect of two other co-defendants.\n\nOn 3 March 2000 the State Treasury lodged an appeal against the judgment.\n\nOn 31 July 2000 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) quashed the impugned judgment in respect of the monthly allowance awarded to the applicant and remitted it to the first-instance court. It upheld the remaining part of the judgment.\n\nIn February and March 2001 the applicant applied to adduce new evidence and asked the court to speed up the proceedings.\n\nThe trial court held the first hearing on 20 September 2001.\n\nIn 2002 the court held four hearings.\n\nOn 19 January 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court held a hearing and on 22 February 2004 it gave a partial judgment (wyrok częściowy).

Talay, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicants alleged that there had been an interference with their right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn 29 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, Senanik Öner and Ferhan Türk, were born in 1952 and 1951 respectively and live in Diyarbakır.\n\nOn 21 March 2007 the applicants attended the Newroz celebrations in Kızıltepe, a district of Mardin, and made certain speeches concerning the problems of Kurdish people. The relevant extracts from the applicants’ statements can be summarised as follows: “For the attention of the press and public: I celebrate your day of Newroz. I commemorate the civilians who were killed by the members of security forces in Cizre, Nusaybin and Şırnak. The PKK declared a ceasefire to stop the bloodshed and to contribute to the peace establishment process. Subsequently, the PKK also withdrew its armed forces out of the borders of Turkey to maintain peace. We expect affirmative steps from the state. (...) The Kurdish leader, “Sayın0” Abdullah Öcalan has been poisoned and this is a very serious problem. Turkey should order an investigation into the Öcalan ‘poisoning’. (...) The state did not take any steps for democratisation or to solve the Kurdish problem. We believe in peace and the state should take appropriate steps for solving the Kurdish problem.’’\n\nSubsequently, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants by the Kızıltepe Public Prosecutor, charging them with disseminating terrorist propaganda on behalf of an illegal organisation, the PKK (Kurdish Workers’ Party, an illegal organisation), under Section 7 § 2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).\n\nOn 15 April 2008 the Diyarbakır Assize Court found the applicants guilty as charged and sentenced them to one year and eight months’ imprisonment.\n\nOn 28 December 2011 the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court’s judgment.\n\nThe applicants learned of this decision on 6 March 2012.\n\nOn 12 October 2012, following an amendment to the law, the Diyarbakır Assize Court revised its judgment pursuant to Provisional Article 1 § 1 of the Law no. 6352 and suspended the execution of the applicants’ sentences.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Senanik Öner - First applicant, born in 1952, lives in Diyarbakır, made speeches at Newroz celebrations, sentenced to one year and eight months' imprisonment for disseminating terrorist propaganda", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Senanik Öner", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "72-73", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Diyarbakır / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr Ferhan Türk - Second applicant, born in 1951, lives in Diyarbakır, made speeches at Newroz celebrations, sentenced to one year and eight months' imprisonment for disseminating terrorist propaganda", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Ferhan Türk", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "73-74", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Diyarbakır / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "Mr E.

Filorinalı and Ms Y. Başara, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and is currently detained on remand in the Edirne F-type prison.\n\nOn 28 November 1992 the applicant was taken into police custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Istanbul Security Directorate. On 10 December 1992 the Istanbul State Security Court ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 5 January 1993 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant and twenty-nine others, charging them with membership of an illegal left-wing organisation, contrary to Article 146 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Law on Prevention of Terrorism.\n\nAt the hearing of 22 November 1993 before the Istanbul State Security Court, which included a military judge, the accused protested against the proceedings by shouting slogans in the hearing room. Following the intervention of the security forces, they broke the windows of the court building.\n\nAt the hearings held between 1993 and 1994 the court heard the testimony of several witnesses and took the statements of the accused.\n\nOn 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of State Security Courts were replaced by civilian judges.\n\nAt the end of almost every hearing the court dismissed the applicant’s request to be released pending trial and ordered his continued detention on remand, having regard to the nature of the offence and the content of the case file. At the hearings during which the applicant was absent the court considered his situation of its own motion and ordered his detention on remand, relying on the same reasons.\n\nAt the hearing of 27 March 2000 the court finished taking the final statements of almost all the accused including the applicant and stated that no additional time would be given to those who had not yet submitted their final observations.\n\nOn 30 July 2001 the applicant filed a petition with a different chamber of the Istanbul State Security Court, complaining about the court’s order for his continued remand in custody. On 1 August 2001 his objection was dismissed on account of the nature of the offence and the content of the case file.\n\nBy 12 October 2001 fifty-five hearings had been held before the Istanbul State Security Court and the judges on the bench of the court had been changed on six occasions.\n\nState Security Courts were abolished by constitutional amendments introduced on 7 May 2004. As a result, all of the procedural safeguards provided for by the ordinary criminal procedure henceforth became applicable to all proceedings without exception.\n\nOn 27 October 2004 the Istanbul Assize Court found the applicant guilty of the charges and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 13 July 2005 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the State Security Court on procedural grounds.\n\nThe case is still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court and the applicant is still in detention on remand.

Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that a delay in releasing him from prison had given rise to a violation of Article 5.\n\nOn 17 March 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Starachowice.\n\nThe applicant was serving a prison sentence in Tarnów Mościce Prison following three separate convictions. The overall term of his imprisonment was due to come to an end on 6 January 2002.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code applicable to re-offenders, the applicant became eligible for conditional release after having served three-quarters of the overall term of his imprisonment, namely on 6 January 1999. After that date, the applicant requested a court on several occasions to grant him conditional release. However, his requests were denied on grounds of insufficient progress in his rehabilitation. On 20 March 2000 the prison governor requested the Tarnów Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) to order the applicant's release (warunkowe przedterminowe zwolnienie) in view of his satisfactory rehabilitation. The Tarnów Regional Prosecutor objected to that request.\n\nOn 22 March 2000 the Tarnów Regional Court gave a decision ordering the applicant's conditional release for a three-year probationary period. It placed the applicant under the court officer's supervision and imposed certain other obligations on him.\n\nThe Tarnów Regional Prosecutor appealed against that decision. The Regional Court did not amend its decision and transmitted the prosecutor's appeal to the Cracow Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny).\n\nThe hearing before the Court of Appeal was scheduled for 12 April 2000 at 8.45 a.m. On that day the Cracow Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Regional Court. No further appeal lay against the decision of the Court of Appeal. In the applicant's submission, the Court of Appeal's decision was delivered at 9 a.m.\n\nLater on 12 April 2000, a certified copy of the Court of Appeal's decision was sent to the Tarnów Regional Court, which received it on 13 April 2000. On the same day the Tarnów Regional Court ordered the governor of the Tarnów Mościce Prison to release the applicant and served him with a copy of the Court of Appeal's decision. The governor received these documents on 14 April 2000.\n\nAccording to the official release certificate, the applicant was released on 14 April 2000. The applicant submitted that he had been released on that date at 4 p.m.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Leszek Gębura - The applicant, Polish national born in 1954, lives in Starachowice, was serving prison sentence and requested conditional release", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Leszek Gębura", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "70-71", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Starachowice / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr J.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-754e7", "number_of_subjects": 7, "annotator": "annotator2", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29366/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr D. Stępniak on 25 July 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 5 January 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Bytom.\n\n1. The applicant's detention\n\nOn 21 October 2002 the applicant was arrested. By a decision of 24 October 2002 the District Court in Wodzisław Śląski remanded him in custody on charges connected with organised crime. It had regard to evidence gathered by the prosecuting authorities which indicated that the applicant had committed the offences concerned. The applicant appealed, to no avail.\n\nThe same court subsequently extended the applicant's detention by decisions of, inter alia, 10 July and 7 October 2003 and 7 March 2004, until, respectively, 15 October 2003, 19 January and 19 July 2004. The court relied on the evidence gathered in the case which pointed to the likelihood of the applicant's guilt. It was also of the view that the applicant, if released, could hinder the proper course of the investigations and judicial proceedings by exerting pressure on witnesses and by colluding with his co-accused. It noted that many persons appeared to have been involved in the commission of the offences concerned and that it was therefore necessary to obtain a considerable amount of evidence. It also had regard to the applicant's criminal record.\n\nOn numerous other occasions the prosecuting authorities refused to release the applicant, relying on the same arguments and referring to the evidence gathered in the investigation.\n\nOn an unspecified number of occasions the applicant was allowed to see his wife during his detention. Between 15 December 2002, the date on which the applicant's wife gave birth to a son, and 21 November 2003 the applicant saw her and his son on at least three occasions.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 the prosecuting authorities lodged a bill of indictment with the Wodzislaw Śląski District Court. The applicant was charged with multiple counts of fraud.\n\nOn 11 December 2003 the court ordered that the applicant should serve a prison sentence imposed on him by a final judgment given in another criminal case concurrently with the present detention.\n\nHearings in the case were held on 7 January, 18 February and 25 October 2004. On the latter date the applicant was convicted as charged.\n\n2. Censorship of the applicant's correspondence\n\nThe applicant submitted envelopes of two letters sent to him by the Court on 15 January 2004 and 30 March 2004. The envelope of the first letter bears the stamp “Censored (cenzurowano) – the Wodzisław Śląski District Court – Date”, signed with an illegible signature. The envelope of the second letter bears the full official stamp of the Wodzisław Śląski District Court and a handwritten note “censorship” (cenzura), accompanied by a handwritten date, 9 April 2004.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr D.

Becerik, lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the refusal by the domestic courts to allow her to bear only her maiden name unjustifiably interfered with her right to protection of her private life under Article 8 in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention.\n\nOn 22 October 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 30 October 1992 the applicant, who is a university professor, got married and took her husband’s surname pursuant to Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code. As she was known by her maiden name in her academic and professional life, she continued using it. However, she could not use it in official documents.\n\nFollowing the amendment made to Article 153 of the Civil Code on 14 May 1997 that entitled married women the right to put their maiden name in front of their husband’s surname, the applicant started to avail herself of this possibility in official documents.\n\nFollowing the adoption of new Civil Code on 22 November 2001, Article 187 was worded identically to the former Article 153.\n\nOn 5 December 2007 the applicant brought proceedings before the Beyoğlu Court of First Instance for permission to use only her maiden name, “Tanbay”.\n\nOn 31 January 2008 the Beyoğlu Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant’s request on the ground that, under Article 187 of the Turkish Civil Code, married women had to bear their husband’s name throughout their marriage and were not entitled to use their maiden name alone.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 14 July 2008 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.\n\nOn 4 December 2008 the applicant’s rectification request was further rejected by the Court of Cassation on the ground that it failed to meet the requirements foreseen in the law and the applicant was fined the equivalent of EUR 80 (euros) as a result. The latter decision was delivered to the applicant on 9 January 2009.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Betül Tanbay Tüten - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1960, university professor living in Istanbul who sought to use only her maiden name after marriage", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Betül Tanbay Tüten", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "64-65", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "PhD", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "University professor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "University (unspecified)", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Professor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms A.

On 22 October he made a formal application for widow’s benefit which was rejected on 27 February 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman.

Çetinkaya, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 20 May 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the lawfulness and length of the applicant’s detention and the absence of an investigation into his detention. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Izmir.\n\nWhile the applicant was in compulsory military service in Kırklareli, on 19 November 2002 he got ten days’ leave and went to Izmir to see his family. He did not return to his barracks afterwards.\n\nOn 22 February 2003 at 3 p.m., the applicant was arrested by police officers at the Narlıdere police station during a routine identity check on suspicion of being an army deserter (asker kaçağı). At 4 p.m. he was taken to the Üçkuyular Military Station Command where the officials determined that he had not returned to his army command when his leave had ended. He was questioned, inter alia, about which army command he belonged to, why he had deserted and whether he had committed a crime during this time.\n\nOn the same day at 8 p.m., the applicant was taken to Şirinyer Military Station Command where he remained in custody. The next day at 11 a.m., he was transferred to the Military Recruitment Office.\n\nOn 7 March 2003 at 1.30 p.m., the applicant was transferred to his army command in Kırklareli. The verbatim record of this transfer noted that the applicant, having committed the offence of army desertion, was requested to be transferred to his army command. It further indicated that the applicant had entered the “security room” on 23 February 2003 and “exited” on 6 March 2003.\n\nOn the same day at 2 p.m., the applicant was questioned by two army officials who informed him that he had committed the offence of exceeding his leave.\n\nBetween 7 March and 11 March 2003, the applicant was held in custody at his army command.\n\nOn 11 March 2003 he was brought before the Çorlu Military Court, which remanded him in custody.\n\nOn 12 March 2003 the Çorlu Military Prosecutor filed an indictment charging the applicant with exceeding his leave (“izin tecavüzü”) under Article 66 § 1 of the Military Criminal Code.\n\nOn 14 April 2003 the Çorlu Military Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment. In its decision the court noted that the applicant had failed to return to his army command at the end of his leave, that he had been apprehended on 22 February 2003 and that he had been held in custody between 7 and 11 March. It deducted the period spent on the road and in custody between 22 February and 11 March 2003 from his prison sentence.\n\nOn 22 April 2003 the judgment of the Çorlu Military Court became final as neither the military prosecutor nor the applicant appealed.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Ergin Erkuş - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1982, lives in Izmir, was in compulsory military service, convicted of exceeding his leave and sentenced to ten months' imprisonment", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Ergin Erkuş", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "42-43", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Izmir / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Soldier", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Turkish Army", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr S.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-b469f", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator2", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 54640/00) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of the United States of America, Mr Thomas R. Sylvester (“the applicant”), on 23 August 1999.\n\nThe Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant complained about the length of proceedings relating to his request to have a divorce decree and custody decision issued by a United States court recognised in Austria.\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 9 October 2003 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nIn April 1994 the applicant married an Austrian citizen. The marriage was concluded in the United States of America and the couple set up their common residence in Michigan. On 11 September 1994, their daughter was born.\n\nOn 31 October 1995, after his wife had left the United States with their daughter without obtaining the applicant’s consent and had set up her residence in Austria, he brought a petition for divorce in the Oakland Circuit Court (Michigan). He also introduced court proceedings in Austria requesting the return of his daughter under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction.\n\nOn 2 November 1995 the applicant’s wife brought a petition for divorce in the Graz District Civil Court.\n\nOn 16 April 1996 the Oakland Circuit Court confirmed a default decree of divorce issued in January 1996, noting that Mrs Sylvester had failed to comply with the requirements for setting aside the default. Further, it awarded the applicant sole custody over the couple’s daughter and ordered that she should reside with him in case of her return.\n\nOn 5 June 1996 the applicant filed a request for recognition of the divorce decree with the Austrian Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn 26 September 1996 the Federal Ministry of Justice refused to grant this request. Referring to Section 24 § 1 of the Fourth Implementing Regulation to the Marriage Act (4. Durchführungsverordnung zum Ehegesetz), it considered that a recognition of the divorce decree would be contrary to Austrian ordre public as the applicant’s wife, being the defendant in the proceedings before the Oakland Circuit Court, had not been heard as she was considered to be in default, despite the fact that the applicant’s petition for divorce had not been duly served on her.\n\nThereupon, on 15 November 1996 the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court. The latter instituted preliminary proceedings on 25 November 1996.\n\nOn 9 January 1997 the Administrative Court received the observations of the Federal Ministry of Justice and, on 20 January 1997, it received the observations of Mrs Sylvester as a third party.\n\nOn 18 December 1998 the Administrative Court referred the case to the Constitutional Court requesting it to review the constitutionality of Section 24 § 1 of the Fourth Implementing Regulation to the Marriage Act.\n\nIt argued that Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which has constitutional rank in Austrian law, applied to the proceedings concerning the recognition of foreign divorce decrees as their outcome had a direct effect on the civil law relationship of the persons concerned. However, it was incompatible with that Article that the Federal Ministry of Justice, an administrative authority, decided upon the request for recognition. The subsequent control by the Administrative Court was not sufficient where the subject matter, such as family law relations, fell within the very core of the notion of “civil rights”.\n\nThe Constitutional Court received the Administrative Court’s request on 19 February 1999. The Administrative Court submitted three further requests raising the same issue, which were received by the Constitutional Court on 13 July, 21 October and 12 November 1999, respectively. The proceedings in these cases were joined to proceedings in the applicant’s case.\n\nOn 4 February 2000 the Administrative Court supplemented its request in the applicant’s case.\n\nOn 28 February 2001 it supplemented its requests in the three other cases.\n\nOn 16 June 2001 the Constitutional Court gave its judgment, finding that Section 24 § 1 of the Fourth Implementing Regulation to the Marriage Act was in conformity with the constitution.\n\nThe Constitutional Court noted firstly that the proceedings at issue were concerned with the questions whether recognition was compatible with Austrian ordre public. Thus, the recognition of foreign divorce decrees was closely linked to the question whether they could be enforced in Austria. Referring to a number of decisions, in which the European Commission of Human Rights had found that Article 6 did not apply to enforcement proceedings, the Constitutional Court expressed doubts as to the applicability of Article 6.\n\nEven assuming that Article 6 applied, referring to the Court’s Zumtobel v. Austria judgment (of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268-A), the Constitutional Court held that the Administrative Court’s scope of review was sufficient, since proceedings concerning the recognition of foreign divorce decrees involved mainly questions of law. Where an assessment of facts was required, as for instance where the question arose whether an action had been duly served, the Administrative Court was empowered to review whether the administrative authority’s assessment was correctly based on the contents of the file.\n\nOn 5 October 2001 having resumed its proceedings, the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The decision was served on the applicant on 29 October 2001.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Thomas R.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-96469", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator2", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31881/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Bedran Gencer (“the applicant”), on 22 July 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr H. Cangir, a lawyer practising in Mardin. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged that, as a result of unfair decisions given by the domestic courts, he had been deprived of his land which was the main source of income for his family. He relied on Articles 6, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nOn 15 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Şanlıurfa.\n\nOn 22 November 1984 Law no. 3083 came into force. Article 5 of this law provided the possibility of leasing State land to farmers who were in need and who fulfilled certain eligibility criteria (“right holders”). In particular, Article 24 § 1 of Law no. 3083 provided that those who had been convicted of certain offences were not entitled to benefit from this law (see paragraph 16 below).\n\nFollowing the promulgation of Law no. 3083, the applicant applied to the Commission which determined the eligibility of farmers to be right holders and requested to be provided with land in Ceylanpınar in the south-east of Turkey.\n\nOn 1 March 1999 the applicant was identified as a right holder and leased land from the Directorate General for Agricultural Reform (Tarım Reformu Genel Müdürlüğü) (“the Directorate General”) for an indefinite period on payment of a rent. The applicant earned his living by cultivating this land.\n\nOn 11 May 2000, after conducting a “security investigation”, the Directorate General annulled the right holder status of the applicant.\n\nOn 31 May 2000 the applicant brought an action in the Gaziantep Administrative Court requesting the stay of execution and reversal of the Directorate General’s decision.\n\nOn 8 June 2000 the Gaziantep Administrative Court decided to request the defendant administration to indicate the reasons which grounded its decision to annul the right holder status of the applicant. The court invited the defendant administration to submit their response and relevant documents within thirty days.\n\nOn 2 August 2000 the Gaziantep Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request for a stay of execution of the decision, holding that necessary conditions were not met.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the Directorate General refused to submit the information or documents requested by the Gaziantep Administrative Court. In this respect, the Directorate General relied on Article 20 § 3 of the Law on Administrative Procedure which provides that the Prime Minister or other Government Minister may refrain from submitting information or documents to an administrative court if the information or documents in question pertain to the security or vital interests of the State.\n\nOn 7 December 2000 the Gaziantep Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case. The court held that the impugned decision of 11 May 2000 and the refusal of the Directorate General to submit the relevant information and documents had been in accordance with the domestic legislation. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 15 April 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. This decision was served on the applicant on 5 July 2002.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Bedran Gencer - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1952, lives in Şanlıurfa, had his right holder status for leased land annulled after a security investigation", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Bedran Gencer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "72-73", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Şanlıurfa / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Farmer", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr H.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974 and lives in İzmir.\n\nOn 18 June 1998 the applicant started working for a company owned by İzmir City Council (“the City Council”). On 19 March 2007 he resigned from his job to perform his military service.\n\nOn 12 April 2007 the applicant was paid 16,985 Turkish liras (TRY ‑ approximately 9,200 euros (EUR)) in respect of severance pay and he signed a release (ibraname) discharging the City Council from all liability.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the military on health grounds shortly after he was enlisted, on 20 April and 31 May 2007 the applicant requested his reinstatement in his previous job. However, his requests were rejected by the City Council.\n\nOn 28 June 2007 the applicant initiated proceedings before the İzmir Labour Court, seeking reinstatement. He relied on clause 19 of the collective bargaining agreement in force at the company (“the collective agreement”), which provided for the reinstatement of employees who had quit their jobs to perform their military service, provided that they applied within three months of their discharge from the armed forces.\n\nOn 12 September 2007, in a decision rendered orally in the presence of the parties, the İzmir Labour Court found in favour of the applicant. The Labour Court held that the applicant’s discharge from the military shortly after he had been enlisted fell under the provision of the collective agreement, which called for the suspension of the employment contract when an employee was conscripted (silah altına alınma) for reasons other than compulsory military service, such as being recalled to the armed forces in times of war. Therefore it held that the applicant was entitled to be reinstated in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. The court informed the parties that they could appeal against this decision within the time-limits set out in the applicable procedure.\n\nOn 18 September 2007 the City Council appealed against the decision and reserved its right to submit additional observations once the reasoned judgment of the first-instance court had been served on it. That appeal was not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 15 October 2007, the registry of the first-instance court forwarded the file to the Court of Cassation for appeal on points of law.\n\nOn 23 October 2007 the City Council submitted its additional observations. It argued, inter alia, that the first-instance court’s interpretation of the collective agreement had been erroneous. These observations were also not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 21 July 2008, following an examination based on the case file and without holding a hearing, the Court of Cassation quashed the first‑instance court’s judgment and found in favour of the City Council. The Court of Cassation found it established that the applicant had resigned from his job to perform his military service and that he had been paid severance pay. It held that a rejection of the applicant’s request for reinstatement could not be regarded as the termination of the applicant’s employment contract; therefore, the applicant could not technically ask to be reinstated. The Court of Cassation further held that clause 19 of the collective agreement was not directly applicable in the case before it. No appeal was possible against this decision.\n\nThis decision was served on the applicant on 22 September 2008.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Özgür Keskin - Turkish national applicant, born in 1974, lives in İzmir, former employee of company owned by İzmir City Council who sought reinstatement after military service", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Özgür Keskin", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "50-51", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "İzmir / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Agent of the Turkish Government - Representative of the Turkish Government in the proceedings", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Government Legal Representative", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Turkish Government", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Agent", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}]}
{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-30c84", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator2", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29840/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hasan Erkan, on 15 August 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented before the Court by Ms Arzu Becerik, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not appoint an agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 24 March 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Yalova. He worked as a teacher and retired on 3 September 1973. On 31 October 1991 he completed a pre-undergraduate (önlisans) course at Anadolu University.\n\nOn 19 February 1992 the applicant applied to the Directorate of Education in Istanbul (Milli Eğitim Müdürlüğü) and requested to be reassigned to a post as a teacher. Since he had obtained a higher education diploma, he expected to be promoted to a higher grade for each year of work as a teacher, in accordance with Article 36 of the Law on Civil Servants (Law No. 657). This, in turn, would entitle him to a higher pension.\n\nOn 5 May 1992 the Ministry of Education appointed the applicant to the post of primary school teacher in Kartal district of Istanbul. This decision was sent to the Kartal District Governor (Kaymakamlık) on 26 May 1992 but not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 7 August 1992 the applicant once again applied to the Istanbul Directorate of Education and found out about the decision of 5 May 1992. On 10 August 1992 he started working as a teacher.\n\nOn 1 October 1992 the applicant's contract was terminated by the Ministry of Education on the ground that when he started to work he was over the age of 65, i.e. the compulsory retirement age in Turkey. Furthermore, the days he worked from 10 August 1992 until 1 October 1992 were not added to the total period of his service. As a result, the applicant could not advance to a higher grade.\n\nOn 17 January 1993 the applicant filed an action before the Ankara Administrative Court and asked for the days he worked in 1992 to be taken into account when calculating the total period of his service. He also stated that the reason for him to start working after he was over the age of sixty-five had been the failure of the authorities to communicate him the decision concerning his assignment.\n\nOn 22 December 1994 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed his request. The applicant appealed on 5 May 1995 but did not pay the necessary appeal fees until 3 August 1995.\n\nOn 27 April 1998 the Council of State quashed the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court. In the opinion of the Council of State, the applicant should have been considered as a civil servant on the day of the appointment and not on the day of his actually taking up his duties.\n\nOn 7 October 1999 the Administrative Court rendered its decision in which it insisted in its decision of 22 December 1994. The Administrative Court considered that the applicant could only be considered as a civil servant on the day he actually started to work, and not on the day of his appointment. It further stated that awarding the statutory rights (özlük hakları) to civil servants before they begin their service had no legal basis in domestic law. In the light of the aforementioned considerations, the court ruled that the applicant did not have the right to advance to a higher grade. The applicant appealed against this decision on 19 January 2000 but did not pay the necessary court fees until 23 May 2000.\n\nOn 15 November 2002 the Joint Council of the Council of State's Administrative Chambers (Danıştay İdari Dava Daireleri Genel Kurulu) upheld the first-instance court's judgment.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-b7175", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator2", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36042/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission on Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Kevin David Willis (“the applicant”), on 24 April 1997.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. Wright, a legal officer with the Child Poverty Action Group, London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley.\n\nThe applicant alleged that British social-security legislation discriminated against him and his late wife on grounds of sex, in breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 11 May 1999 the Chamber declared the application admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court's decision is obtainable from the Registry].\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections. This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a British national born in 1956 and living in Bristol.\n\nIn December 1984 the applicant married Marlene Willis. They had two children: Natasha Uma, born on 24 March 1989, and Ross Amal, born on 2 August 1990. Mrs Willis died of cancer on 7 June 1996, at the age of 39. The applicant is the administrator of his late wife's estate.\n\nMrs Willis had been employed as a local authority housing officer. For the greater part of her married life, she was the primary breadwinner. She had paid full social-security contributions as an employed earner until 1994, and was subsequently entitled to contribution credits as a person unfit for work. On 3 November 1995 the applicant gave up work to nurse his wife and care for their children. Following his wife's death, he worked part time between 2 September 1996 and 6 November 1996, for an annual salary of 4,393 pounds sterling (GBP), but since this proved uneconomic he stopped working to care full time for the children.\n\nOn 4 November 1996 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for the payment of social-security benefits. He applied for benefits equivalent to those which a widow whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of Mrs Willis would have been entitled, namely a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992.\n\nBy a letter dated 18 November 1996, the Benefits Agency informed the applicant that the benefits he had claimed did not exist for widowers, and that his claim accordingly could not be accepted as valid. The letter continued: “I am afraid I can only explain that the Government says that it has no plans to introduce a widowers' pension on the same line as the existing widows' benefits. It may help if I explain the current policy underlying widows' benefits was established at a time when married women rarely worked. It is based on the assumption that women are more likely than men to have been financially dependent on their spouse's earnings and therefore more likely on widowhood to face greater financial hardship. The benefits themselves are concentrated on those widows who are perceived to have the greatest problems, those with children and older women who may have been out of the labour market for many years. It is accepted that social patterns have changed considerably since the provisions were first introduced. However, it is still broadly the case that on bereavement, women are more likely than men to be in financial need. For instance, most widowers of working age will have been in employment before the death of their wives. They will not therefore have the same degree of difficulty in supporting themselves as widows who may have been out of the labour market for some time and may find it difficult to obtain paid work. Women on average earn less than men. So even for women who have been working, the financial loss on widowhood is likely to be significantly more than for men. Widows' benefits are not means tested and are paid regardless of the level of the widows' earnings. The Government says that the extension of the benefits on the same basis to widowers would mean substantial extra expenditure in paying maintenance benefit to men who are likely to be already maintaining themselves by their earnings, and in some cases, very high earnings indeed. To make existing widows' benefits provisions available to widowers would add an estimated GBP 490 million to the annual Social Security budget. The Government is of the opinion that at a time when all areas of public expenditure are having to be carefully considered, this is simply not a best use of scarce resources. In making these points, the Government says that it is in no way minimising the sad problems faced by widowers, in particular those left with small children to care for. For them there are already available benefits such as Child Benefit and One Parent Benefit, together with the range of income-related benefits, for example, Income Support for those not in full time work and Family Credit for low paid workers. In the Government's view this remains the fairest way of providing benefits to meet specific need rather than an extension of widows' benefits along the lines suggested. ...”\n\nThe applicant lodged a statutory appeal against this decision on 17 February 1997. The Social Security Appeal Tribunal declined jurisdiction on the basis that no appealable decision had been made.\n\nThe applicant currently receives child benefit and, in respect of his son Ross, received a disability living allowance and an invalid care allowance for a period following his wife's death. He is also in receipt of a widower's pension under Mrs Willis's occupational pension scheme. The applicant has capital, much of which is derived from a joint endowment policy (for which he and Mrs Willis had paid premiums) which matured on Mrs Willis's death, from which he obtains a further income of about GBP 150 per month. Because of his savings, the applicant does not qualify for means-tested benefits such as income support or family credit. All the social-security benefits he receives would also be received by a widow, who would in addition be paid a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance.\n\nCOMPLAINTS\n\nThe applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to pay him the social-security benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely a widowed mother's allowance and a widow's payment, constituted discrimination against him and his wife on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with each of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He made an identical complaint as regards his future non-entitlement to a widow's pension. He complained also of a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Kevin David Willis - The applicant, British national born in 1956, living in Bristol, widower seeking social security benefits", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Kevin David Willis", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "68-69", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Bristol / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Widowed", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr S.

Şahin, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 31 August 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings against the applicant on account of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Erzurum State Security Court to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Edirne.\n\nAt the material time, the applicant was the owner and editor of a local newspaper published in Trabzon, the Özgür Karadeniz (“The Free Black Sea”).\n\nOn 15 January 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 20 January 1995 he was brought before a judge who ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 10 March 1995 the public prosecutor at the Erzincan State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, along with twenty-one other persons. The applicant was accused of membership of an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C (the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party- Front). According to the indictment, following his arrest, the applicant's house was searched by police officers who found illegal periodicals, newspapers, books and a bullet. The public prosecutor also alleged that the applicant had published a newspaper containing propaganda in support of the DHKP-C, participated in illegal demonstrations, put up posters, distributed leaflets supporting the DHKP-C and carried out activities in the Karadeniz University for the recruitment of new members for the illegal organisation.\n\nOn 13 March 1995 the applicant was transferred to the Erzurum special type prison.\n\nOn different dates in 1995, five other criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant before various courts, with charges of disseminating separatist propaganda and incitement to hatred and hostility through the medium of his newspaper.\n\nThe cases against the applicant and his co-accused were subsequently joined before the Erzincan State Security Court.\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law no. 4210, which abolished the Erzincan State Security Court and established the Erzurum State Security Court, in 1997 the Erzurum State Security Court acquired jurisdiction over the case and the case-file was sent to it.\n\nOn 27 November 1998 the Erzurum State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP-C. The court found that two articles published in Özgür Karadeniz on 15 November 1994 and 1 March 1995 contained separatist propaganda and incitement to hatred. It further found it established that the applicant had participated in illegal demonstrations, put up posters, distributed leaflets supporting the DHKP-C and carried out activities in the Karadeniz University for the recruitment of new members for the illegal organisation.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-9c7ad", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator2", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 316/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Serap Demirci (“the applicant”), on 25 December 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr İ. Akın and Ms N.Ö. Akın, lawyers practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged that her right of access to court had been breached by a domestic court’s refusal to grant her legal aid.\n\nOn 25 May 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Izmir.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 2006 she initiated administrative proceedings against the Ege University Hospital, claiming compensation. She indicated, inter alia, that the doctors at the said hospital had not acted diligently during the numerous reconstructive operations she had undergone, which had resulted in severe complications affecting her ears and eyes. The applicant sought a total of 205,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (136,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, submitting medical records in support of her claims. The applicant also applied for legal aid for the required court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the mayor of the neighbourhood (muhtar) in which she lived attesting to her poverty.\n\nOn 26 January 2006 the Izmir Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s legal aid application, after having stated that pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, an application for legal aid must be supported by proof that the case is well-founded and that the claimant does not have the means to pay the required court fees.\n\nOn 6 February 2006 the court informed the applicant that she was required to pay a total of TRY 2,767 (approximately EUR 1,800 at the time) in court fees within thirty days in order for the proceedings to be continued.\n\nSubsequently, on 22 March 2006 the applicant applied for legal aid again and submitted additional documents proving her poor financial situation, including certificates from the Çiğli Directorate of Land Registration, the Revenue Department and the Directorate of Income, which indicated respectively that she did not own any immovable property, had no records in the tax roll and had no income. She also argued that her case was well-founded. On 29 March 2006 her application was rejected once more.\n\nOn 17 April 2006 the applicant was warned for the second time that she was required pay the required fees within thirty days in order for the proceedings to be continued.\n\nOn 14 June 2006 the Izmir Administrative Court decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees. That decision was served on the applicant on 29 June 2006.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Serap Demirci - Turkish national applicant, born in 1980, lives in Izmir, initiated administrative proceedings against Ege University Hospital seeking compensation for medical complications", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Serap Demirci", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "44-45", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Izmir / Türkiye", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr İ.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-71e52", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 46347/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Mrs Myra Xenides-Arestis (“the applicant”), on 4 November 1998.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Demetriades, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Prof. Dr Z. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 14. In particular, she maintained that the Turkish military forces were preventing her from having access to, using and enjoying her home and property in the area of Famagusta, in northern Cyprus. She submitted that this was due to the fact that she was Orthodox and of Greek-Cypriot origin.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nA hearing on the admissibility of the application took place in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 2 September 2004.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) but this case remained with the Chamber constituted within former Section III.\n\nBy a decision of 14 March 2005 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1) and the Government sent comments on the applicant’s claims for just satisfaction. The Government of Cyprus, who had made use of their right to intervene under Article 36 of the Convention, did not submit any comments on the parties’ observations.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant, Mrs Myra Xenides-Arestis, is a Cypriot national of Greek-Cypriot origin, who was born in 1945 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant owns property in the area of Ayios Memnon (Esperidon Street), in the fenced-up area of Famagusta, that she acquired by way of a gift from her mother. In particular, she owns half a share in a plot of land (plot no. 142, sheet/plan 33/29) with buildings thereon, consisting of one shop, one flat and three houses. One of the houses was her home, where she lived with her husband and children, whereas the rest of the property was used by members of the family and/or rented out to third parties. Furthermore, the applicant partly owns a plot of land (plot no. 158, sheet/plan 33/29) with an orchard (her share being equivalent to 5/48). This was registered in her name on 31 January 1984. The rest of the property is owned by other members of her family.\n\nIn August 1974 she was forced by the Turkish military forces to leave Famagusta with her family and abandon their home, property and possessions. Since then she has been prevented from having access to, using and enjoying her home and property, which are under the occupation and the control of the Turkish military forces. According to the applicant, only the Turkish military forces have access to the fenced-up area of Famagusta.\n\nOn 23 April 2003 new measures were adopted by the authorities of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”) regarding crossings from northern to southern Cyprus and vice versa through specified checkpoints. On 30 June 2003 the “Parliament of the TRNC” enacted “Law no. 49/2003” on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the “TRNC”, which entered into force on the same day. On 30 July 2003, under Article 11 of this “Law”, an “Immovable Property, Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission” was established in the “TRNC”. The rules of the commission were published in the “TRNC Official Gazette” on 15 August 2003 and the commission was constituted by a decision of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” published in the aforementioned gazette on 18 August 2003.\n\nOn 24 April 2004 two separate referendums were held simultaneously in Cyprus on the Foundation Agreement–Settlement Plan (“Annan Plan”) which had been finalised on 31 March 2004. Since the plan was approved in the Turkish-Cypriot referendum but not in the Greek-Cypriot referendum, the Foundation Agreement did not enter into force.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mrs Myra Xenides-Arestis - Cypriot national of Greek-Cypriot origin, born in 1945, lives in Nicosia, the applicant who owns property in Famagusta that she was forced to abandon in 1974", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Myra Xenides-Arestis", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "79-80", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Nicosia / Cyprus", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Cyprus", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-04e12", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 25929/05) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Karl Strobel (“the applicant”), on 22 June 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr F. Zimmermann, a lawyer practising in Klagenfurt. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs.\n\nOn 6 November 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe German Government did not make use of their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a university professor of ancient history and archeology who was appointed at Klagenfurt University in 1998. Under the terms of appointment he was entitled to reimbursement of the removal costs and to a household allowance. In April 2001 the sum of 5,699.21 euros (EUR) was paid to the applicant.\n\nOn 6 July 2001 the applicant claimed reimbursement of the remaining removal costs in the sum of EUR 4,684.40 and payment of the household allowance in the sum of EUR 5,443.70, plus 4.5% interest since August 1999.\n\nThe Dean of Klagenfurt University dismissed the applicant’s claim on 16 January 2002.\n\nThe applicant appealed on 29 January 2002 to the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (“the Ministry”).\n\nThe Ministry did not decide within the statutory six-month time-limit laid down in section 73 § 1 of the General Administrative Proceedings Act. In August 2002 the applicant brought court proceedings relating to the claims at issue. A conditional settlement was reached but was revoked by the applicant in January 2003. The applicant’s action was dismissed in February 2003.\n\nMeanwhile, on 18 November 2002, the applicant complained to the Administrative Court under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution about the administration’s failure to determine his claim. On 29 November 2002 the Administrative Court ordered the Ministry of Education to issue a decision within three months.\n\nOn 3 March 2003 the Ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal.\n\nThe applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court on 16 April 2003. The Ministry filed observations in reply on 24 June 2003.\n\nOn 24 February 2006 the Administrative Court quashed the Ministry’s decision as being unlawful.\n\nBy decision of 25 July 2006 the Ministry referred the case back to the Dean of Klagenfurt University for a new decision. Meanwhile on 8 May 2006 the applicant supplemented his claims, apparently requesting reimbursement of costs incurred for travelling between Klagenfurt and his former place of residence.\n\nOn 16 October 2006 the applicant was summoned to a hearing and two days later the sum of EUR 4,000 was paid to the applicant with a view to reaching a settlement.\n\nThe hearing took place on 20 November 2006. According to the minutes the hearing served the purpose of establishing the plausibility of the applicant’s claims as submitted on 6 July 2001 and supplemented on 8 May 2006 and to determine their amount with the participation of the applicant. It is then noted that, in the light of the explanations given, the costs and interest claimed seemed plausible. At the close of the hearing the parties concluded a friendly settlement with the following terms: “(a) Klagenfurt University thus declares its willingness to transfer, in addition to the payment already made of EUR 4,000 and the regulated transport costs in the amount of EUR 5,699.21, the lump-sum of EUR 10,000 within 14 days to the account of Professor Strobel. (b) Professor Strobel, for his part, withdraws all requests in connection with the proceedings at issue. As a result, the demands and claims asserted in the present proceedings are completely settled and complied with.”", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Karl Strobel - German national, university professor of ancient history and archeology appointed at Klagenfurt University in 1998, the applicant in this case", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Karl Strobel", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Klagenfurt / Austria", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "PhD", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "University professor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Klagenfurt University", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Professor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr F.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-ad46d", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 17725/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Necmettin Alkan (“the applicant”), on 11 April 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms L. Alkan, his mother. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his right of access to court had been breached by the domestic court’s refusal to grant him legal aid.\n\nOn 25 May 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Kars.\n\nOn 13 December 2002, after having completed his military service, the applicant was placed under the guardianship of his father, S.A., by a decision of the Sarıkamış Magistrates’ Court as he was mentally ill and needed constant supervision.\n\nThe applicant submitted several requests to the gendarmerie command claiming compensation for his illness which, according to him, began during his military service as a result of the treatment there. His requests were rejected on the basis of a medical report from the Gülhane Military Medical Academy, which indicated that such a condition could not have been caused merely by military service and that many other factors could have been involved in its development.\n\nSubsequently, under the guardianship of S.A., the applicant initiated compensation proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, claiming that his illness had been caused by the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected in the army. He argued that his enrolment for military service after having passed several medical tests was proof that he had been healthy before. The applicant requested a total of 200,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 100,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in respect of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, submitting the medical records from several hospitals in support of his claims. He also requested legal aid for the court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtar) attesting to his father’s poverty. The certificate stated that neither S.A. nor anyone else from his household was employed. It also indicated that he was ill, had no social security and depended on support from his neighbours.\n\nBy two decisions of 19 July and 1 November 2006 respectively, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s legal aid request, stating that pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, a legal aid request must be supported by proof that the case is well-founded and that the plaintiff does not have the means to pay the required court fees. It concluded that the requirements had not been met in the applicant’s case.\n\nOn 6 November 2006 the court informed the applicant that he was to pay a total of TRY 2,719 (approximately EUR 1,400 at the time) in court fees within thirty days for the proceedings to be continued.\n\nOn 10 January 2007 the Supreme Military Administrative Court decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Necmettin Alkan - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1979, lives in Kars, placed under guardianship due to mental illness after military service, seeking compensation for illness allegedly caused during military service", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Necmettin Alkan", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "45-46", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Kars / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms L.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-fc115", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 58453/00) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Jaroslaw Niedzwiecki (“the applicant”), on 27 October 1999.\n\nThe German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Stoltenberg, Ministerialdirigent, and, subsequently, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialrätin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the refusal of child benefits between July and December 1995 amounted to discrimination in the exercise of his right to respect for family life.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 17 June 2003 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1961. At the time the application was lodged he lived in Erlenbach in Germany. He currently resides in Swidnica in Poland.\n\n1. The applicant’s situation in Germany\n\nThe applicant immigrated to Germany in February 1987. His request for asylum was rejected. His expulsion was, however, suspended under the agreement of the Home Secretaries of the Länder not to expel Polish nationals (“Ostblockbeschlüsse” der Innenminister der Länder). In November 1989 the applicant obtained a provisional residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis). In January 1991, following an amendment of the Aliens Act, he was issued with a limited residence title for exceptional purposes (Aufenthaltsbefugnis). This residence title was renewed every two years, the last time in January 1995 until January 1997. In April 1997 the applicant obtained an unlimited residence permit (Aufenthaltsberechtigung).\n\nIn July 1995 the applicant’s daughter was born.\n\n2. The child benefit proceedings before the Labour Office\n\nOn 28 July 1995 the applicant applied to the Aschaffenburg Labour Office (Arbeitsamt) for child benefits according to Section 1 of the Federal Child Benefits Act (Bundeskindergeldgesetz, see relevant domestic law below).\n\nOn 18 August 1995 the Labour Office dismissed the applicant’s request under Section 1 § 3 of the Child Benefits Act. It noted that the applicant only had a limited residence title for exceptional purposes, and no unlimited residence permit or provisional residence permit, as required under Section 1 § 3.\n\nOn 12 October 1995 the Federal Labour Office (Bundesanstalt für Arbeit) rejected his objection.\n\n3. The proceedings before the Social Court\n\nThe applicant lodged an action with the Würzburg Social Court (Sozialgericht), claiming that he had been residing in Germany since 1987 and that he should, therefore, have the right to child benefits.\n\nOn 21 April 1997 the Social Court dismissed the applicant’s action regarding child benefits between July 1995 and April 1997. It confirmed that only aliens with an unlimited residence permit or with a provisional residence permit were entitled to the payment of child benefits under Section 1 § 3 of the Child Benefits Act, as in force until 31 December 1995. According to the Social Court, the legislature had only intended to grant child benefits to aliens who were likely to stay in Germany on a permanent basis. Aliens with only a limited residence title for exceptional purposes were, however, not likely to stay. The court further pointed out that this distinction did not violate the German Basic Law. In the present case, the legislature had remained within its wide margin of appreciation in social law matters.\n\n4. The appeal proceedings\n\nOn 23 April 1998 the Bavarian Social Court of Appeal (Landessozialgericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal to the extent that his claims under the Child Benefits Act until 31 December 1995 were concerned. The Court of Appeal confirmed the lower court’s reasoning, noting that the applicant did not have a stable residence permit in 1995, as his limited residence title for exceptional purposes had had to be renewed every two years. Likewise, referring to the wide margin of appreciation of the legislature, it took the view that Section 1 § 3 of the Federal Child Benefits Act was compatible with the Basic Law. In this respect, it considered that until December 1995 families had benefited from child benefits and tax deductions (Kinderfreibetrag) as a system of compensation (dualer Familienlastenausgleich). The applicant and his wife had paid taxes in 1995 but had not obtained child benefits. In the court’s view, this taxation, not the refusal of child benefits, might have violated the Basic Law; however, it was not for the social courts to decide on that matter.\n\nOn 18 March 1999 the Federal Social Court (Bundessozialgericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law.\n\nThe applicant lodged a constitutional complaint combined with a request for an interim measure. He claimed that the relevant provision of the Federal Child Benefits Act was discriminatory and racist, and violated his right to respect for his family life. In addition, he alleged that the refusal of his request for child benefits infringed the principle of social justice (Sozialstaatsprinzip) laid down in Article 20 § 4 of the Basic Law.\n\nOn 21 October 1999 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to entertain his complaint and rejected his request for an interim measure.\n\n5. The proceedings concerning claims after 1 January 1996\n\nOn 3 July 2001 the Würzburg Social Court decided that it was not competent to deal with the applicant’s claims regarding child benefits for the period after 1 January 1996 and transferred the proceedings to the Nuremberg Tax Court (Finanzgericht).

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-ea762", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 6813/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Fatih Taş (“the applicant”), on 17 December 2008.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr İ. Akmeşe and Ms Y. Polat, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 9 January 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Istanbul. He was the owner and the editor-in-chief of a publishing house, Aram Basım ve Yayıncılık, which published a periodical, Vesta.\n\nIn 2004 an article written by Mr M.Ş. entitled “On the Kurdish Intellectual” was published in Vesta.\n\nOn 29 December 2004 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul Assize Court, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). According to the indictment, certain passages of the article depicted the PKK0 as part of the Kurdish intellectual movement and hence constituted propaganda of the organisation, known for employing violence and terror.\n\nOn 23 September 2008 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant of disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 as he had published the article in question in Vesta.\n\nIn its judgment, the Istanbul Assize Court cited the following passages from the article: “In Kurdish history, there have been moments, in certain periods, during which Kurdish literature and culture developed and shone. In those moments, sparks of thought appeared. However, objectively and without renouncing the past, the conditions of the birth of Kurdish intellectualism are based on the 1970s. In earlier periods, there had only been individual and temporary developments not creating traditions. The political nature of the 20th century, the existence and rise of national liberation movements, the emergence of modern currents in Kurdish politics and, most importantly, the creation of a mass movement, served as the basis for the birth of the Kurdish intellectual. This process was manifested in the figure of the PKK. All political movements before the PKK were rebellious, devoid of political depth, tactical unity, stable path and permanence. The ideological and intellectual superficiality of these revolts and their fierce repression led to the loss of existing knowledge and to falling behind. From this point of view, through political and thoughtful analysis, while being free from the system and alienation, and bearing within it its own cultural identity based on the impoverished Kurdish rustics, [the PKK] allowed the beginning of a permanent and stable political enlightenment process. ... Another characteristic of the PKK movement at the beginning was that it realised that [the previous] abstract and theoretical movements had not led to a solution but deepened the problem. ... The fact that the PKK movement was based on the impoverished Kurdish rustics who were intact and preserved their national identity paved the way for a start favourable for a confident, militant and revolutionary tradition. Yet, the progress of the movement was accompanied by the downfall of the level of quality.”\n\nThe court considered that the aforementioned passages and the article in its entirety constituted propaganda in favour of the PKK. It hence sentenced the applicant to ten months’ imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of 375 Turkish liras (TRY). Taking into account his good behaviour during the trial and his character, the court suspended the pronouncement of his conviction on condition that he did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, under Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması).\n\nOn 22 October 2008 the court dismissed an objection lodged by the applicant against the above-mentioned decision.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Fatih Taş - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1979, lives in Istanbul, owner and editor-in-chief of Aram Basım ve Yayıncılık publishing house, convicted of disseminating propaganda", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Fatih Taş", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "45-46", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Publisher/Editor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Aram Basım ve Yayıncılık", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Owner and Editor-in-Chief", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr İ.

It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Van.\n\nOn 29 August 2000 the applicant was admitted to the military service.\n\nOn 7 September 2001 he went to see a doctor at the Sivas Military Hospital for an eye-sight problem. His medical report stated that he had ‑ 6, 25 of myopia (nearsightedness), +0,25 of hyperopia (farsightedness) and – 6,75 of anisometropia amblyopia (difference in refractive error between the two eyes leading to reduced vision in one eye) on his left eye. The report noted that the applicant had complained that he had had the problem on his left eye since childhood. Accordingly, the applicant was discharged from the military as he was no longer eligible for service.\n\nOn 17 March 2003, the applicant applied to both, the Retired Civil Servant’s Fund for a pension and to the Compensation Commission at the Ministry of the Interior for compensation. Both requests were rejected.\n\nOn 21 May 2003 the applicant obtained a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtarlık) attesting his indigence.\n\nOn 5 June 2003, the applicant brought an action against the Ministry of the Interior before the Supreme Military Administrative Court requesting compensation of 30,000,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL)0. In his petition the applicant alleged, inter alia, that he had no such eye problems prior to his service in the army. He further referred to the doctrine of “social risk”, which did not require the establishment of any causal link between the harmful action and the loss. The applicant also requested legal aid to cover the payment of the court fees.\n\nOn 24 July 2003 the Supreme Military Administrative Court, after examining the case file and hearing the observations of the rapporteur, dismissed the applicant’s request for legal aid on the ground that the case was not well‑founded.\n\nOn 25 July 2003, the Supreme Military Administrative Court notified the applicant that he was required to pay a court fee which was TRL 476,970,000 (approximately 292 euros).\n\nIn the meantime, on 19 August 2008, the applicant was examined by doctors at Van State Hospital.

Hoş, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 8 July 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning a lack of a fair trial by an impartial and independent tribunal within a reasonable time, a failure to observe the presumption of innocence, a lack of adequate facilities for the preparation of the defence, and a lack of legal assistance during detention. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nBoth the applicants and the Government submitted their observations outside the time limit. They have therefore not been admitted to the case file.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, Mr Adem Kepeneklioğlu and Mr Mehmet Hakan Canpolat, are Turkish nationals, who were born in 1954 and 1964 respectively. When they lodged their application with the Court they were imprisoned in Turkey.\n\nOn 29 and 30 June 1992 the applicants were taken into custody in Istanbul by police officers from the Istanbul Anti-Terrorist Branch. On 13 July 1992 they were detained on remand.\n\nOn 27 July 1992 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment accusing the applicants of, inter alia, organised murder and armed burglary, as well as being members of an illegal terrorist organization.\n\nOn 25 November 1992 the Istanbul State Security Court commenced the trial against the applicants and three other accused and prolonged the applicants' detention.\n\nOn 3 April 1998 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicants under Article 146 of the Criminal Code and sentenced them to death.\n\nOn 10 March 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment.\n\nOn 12 June 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted them of the same crimes.\n\nOn 4 February 2002, upon the applicants' appeal, the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the State Security Court.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Adem Kepeneklioğlu - First applicant, Turkish national born in 1954, convicted of organized murder, armed burglary, and membership in illegal terrorist organization, sentenced to death", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Adem Kepeneklioğlu", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "70-71", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mehmet Hakan Canpolat - Second applicant, Turkish national born in 1964, convicted of organized murder, armed burglary, and membership in illegal terrorist organization, sentenced to death", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Mehmet Hakan Canpolat", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "60-61", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "Y.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-73f74", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 42967/98) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Mr Philemon Löffelmann (“the applicant”), on 9 July 1998.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr R. Kohlhofer, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had been discriminated against in the exercise of his rights under Articles 4 and 9 of the Convention on the ground of his religion as he was liable for military or alternative civilian service whereas members of recognised religious societies holding religious functions comparable to his functions were exempted.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 1 February 2005 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nNeither the applicant nor the Government filed further written observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Maissau.\n\nUpon his baptism on 9 July 1994 he became a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in Austria, within which he assumed the function of a preacher or “regular pioneer” (Prediger, allgemeiner Pionier) and, since 27 November 1996, a deacon or “ministerial servant” (Diakon, Dienstamtgehilfe). In this function he assisted the clerical work of elders of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nOn 17 November 1994 the Lower Austrian Military Authority (Militärkommando) found that the applicant was fit to perform military service. On 3 July 1995 the applicant started his military service; however, on 1 August 1995 he was discharged following a military medical expert opinion that had found him unfit for service.\n\nOn 28 September 1995 the Lower Austrian Military Authority issued a conscription order (Stellungsbescheid) in respect of the applicant, ordering him to undergo another examination as to his ability to perform military service pursuant to section 24(8) of the Military Service Act (Wehrgesetz), as in force at the relevant time. As to the applicant’s argument that he should be exempted from military service under section 24(3) of the Military Service Act, it noted that the applicant was not a member of a recognised religious society.\n\nThe applicant appealed against that order, claiming in particular that he should be dispensed from military service since he performed a function within the Jehovah’s Witnesses which was equivalent to that of members of a recognised religious society who were exempted from military service under section 24(3) of the Military Service Act. To restrict such a privilege to members of recognised religious societies was not objectively justified and was therefore in breach of the Federal Constitution.\n\nOn 16 November 1995 the Federal Minister for Defence (Bundesminister für Landesverteidigung) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the lower authority’s decision.\n\nOn 8 January 1996 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof), requesting it to repeal the wording “recognised religious societies” in section 24(3) of the Military Service Act.\n\nOn 1 December 1997 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint for lack of prospects of success. It referred to an earlier decision by which it had found that the obligation to perform military or civilian service raised no concerns as regards compliance with Article 9 of the Convention.\n\nOn 26 March 1998 the Administrative Court (Verwaltungs-gerichtshof) dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It noted that the applicant had solely complained about section 24(3) of the Military Service Act in conjunction with the 1998 Act on the Legal Status of Registered Religious Communities (Bundesgesetz über die Rechtspersönlichkeit von religiösen Bekenntnisgemeinschaften – hereafter referred to as the “1998 Act”), which had entered into force on 10 January 1998. However, the Administrative Court had to limit its examination of the legality of the drafting order to the legal situation at the time when the order had been issued. Referring to the case-law quoted by the Constitutional Court, it found no concerns as regards the legality of the drafting order and therefore also no indication to institute proceedings to review constitutionality (Gesetzesprüfungsverfahren) as proposed by the applicant.\n\nOn 14 May 1998 the Lower Austrian Military Authority issued another conscription order for an examination of the applicant’s fitness to perform military service.\n\nOn 19 May 1998 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court against the order. He submitted in particular that by virtue of the 1998 Act, the Jehovah’s Witnesses had been granted the status of a “registered religious community”. However, the ten-year period for a successful application for recognition under the Recognition Act (Anerkennungsgesetz), newly introduced by section 11 of the 1998 Act, lacked objective justification. Furthermore, it precluded any recognition for the following ten years. Since section 24(3) of the Military Service Act referred to “recognised religious societies” and restricted exemption from military service to members of recognised religious societies, the applicant again requested the Constitutional Court to revoke this limitation and also to revoke the ten-year period prescribed in section 11 of the 1998 Act.\n\nOn 8 June 1998 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the complaint for lack of prospects of success.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-90d80", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 63879/00) against the French Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Tunisian national, Mr Laïfa Ben Naceur (“the applicant”), on 13 September 2000.\n\nThe French Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr R. Abraham, and his successor, Ms E. Belliard, Director of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the additional time granted to the Principal Public Prosecutor for appealing against a judgment of the Criminal Court amounted to a breach of the principle of equality of arms as enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nIn a decision of 29 November 2005 the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nNeither the Government nor the applicant filed further written observations on the merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and is currently detained in Muret Prison (Haute-Garonne).\n\nOn 22 February 1999 the Lyons Criminal Court sentenced the applicant, who had been represented by counsel at trial, to seven years’ imprisonment and ordered his permanent exclusion from French territory for drug trafficking while classified in law as a recidivist.\n\nNeither the applicant nor the public prosecutor appealed against the judgment within the ten-day time-limit laid down in Article 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nOn 8 March 1999 the public prosecutor asked the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Lyons Court of Appeal to lodge an appeal; the Principal Public Prosecutor did so in a notice of appeal served on 16 March 1999 in accordance with Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by which the Principal Public Prosecutor has two months from the date of delivery of the Criminal Court judgment in which to lodge an appeal.\n\nBefore the Court of Appeal, the Principal Public Prosecutor – the only appellant – submitted that the applicant should be sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment and permanently excluded from French territory.\n\nThe applicant filed submissions urging the Court of Appeal to declare the appeal inadmissible for non-compliance with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and the principle of equality of arms in that it had been lodged outside the time-limit applicable to the public prosecutor at the Criminal Court and to himself. He also challenged the finding as to his guilt.\n\nOn 1 July 1999 the Lyons Court of Appeal upheld the judgment as to the issue of guilt and the permanent exclusion from French territory, and increased the sentence to twelve years’ imprisonment, with a minimum term of two-thirds of the sentence. Addressing the applicant’s plea of inadmissibility, the Court of Appeal held: “Under Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Principal Public Prosecutor may lodge an appeal within two months from the date of delivery of the judgment. This opportunity granted to the Principal Public Prosecutor is not at variance with the provisions of Article 6 of the aforementioned Convention where, as in this instance, the right of appeal is also available to the defendant. The appeal by the Principal Public Prosecutor must be declared admissible.”\n\nThe applicant appealed on points of law and filed additional submissions in which he reiterated his argument that Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not comply with the principle of equality of arms enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention. He also relied on the case-law of the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation, which had ruled that Article 546 of the Code of Criminal Procedure infringed Article 6 of the Convention in that it afforded only the Principal Public Prosecutor the right to appeal against certain judgments concerning petty offences (contraventions).\n\nIn a judgment of 15 March 2000 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law, holding as follows: “In declaring the appeal by the Principal Public Prosecutor admissible, the Court of Appeal stated that the opportunity granted to the latter to lodge an appeal within two months from the date of delivery of the judgment, in accordance with Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was not at variance with the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights where, as in this instance, the right of appeal was also available to the defendant. In so holding, and in so far as Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not deprive the defendant of a remedy that could be used by the Principal Public Prosecutor but simply subjects him to different formal conditions and time-limits from those applicable to the Principal Public Prosecutor, the judges applied the law correctly ...”", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Laïfa Ben Naceur - Tunisian national, born in 1951, the applicant in this case, currently detained in Muret Prison, convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to imprisonment", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Laïfa Ben Naceur", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "73-74", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Muret Prison / Muret / France", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Tunisia", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr R.

Aslan, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 28 March 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the lack of legal assistance in police custody and the non-communication of the submissions of the Principal Public Prosecutor, to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Izmir.\n\nOn 29 May 2001, the applicant was arrested by police officers from the anti-terrorism branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of having participated in an illegal demonstration in support of the imprisoned leader of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an illegal organisation). The applicant was also accused of hanging an illegal placard on a bridge in Bornova on 26 April 2001.\n\nOn 30 May 2001 the police officers took a statement from the applicant in which he admitted the charges.\n\nOn 1 June 2001 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge. Before both officials, the applicant denied the content of his police statement, alleging that it had been extracted from him under duress. The same day, the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nOn 11 July 2001 the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed an indictment with the same court, accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting the PKK, an offence under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of Law no. 3713 (the anti-terrorism law).\n\nOn 5 December 2001 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment. This sentence was then reduced to two and a half years’ imprisonment as the applicant had been less than eighteen years of age at the time of the offence.\n\nWhen delivering its judgment, the Izmir State Security Court had taken into consideration the statements which the applicant had made to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, as well as his co-defendants’ testimony before the public prosecutor. The court noted that the latter had given evidence that the applicant had organised them to participate in the demonstration. The court further took note of the expert report which suggested that the applicant’s handwriting was identical to that on the placard. The court also noted that, according to the arrest report drawn up by the police, the applicant had been among the people who dispersed after the demonstration.\n\nOn 27 March 2002, the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion to the 9th Chamber of the Court of Cassation, in which he had argued that the Chamber should uphold the judgment of the Izmir State Security Court.\n\nOn 10 June 2002 the 9th Chamber of the Court of Cassation confirmed that judgment.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Yusuf Salduz - Turkish national applicant, born in 1984, lives in Izmir, arrested for participating in illegal demonstration and hanging illegal placard, sentenced to reduced term due to being under 18 at time of offense", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Yusuf Salduz", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "40-41", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Izmir / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms. T.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-4bc97", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 53911/00) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Austrian nationals, Mr Johann Achleitner and Mrs Christiana Achleitner (“the applicants”), on 27 September 1999.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr W. Hasibeder, a lawyer practising in Ried (Austria).\n\nThe Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 20 June 2002 the First Section declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicants were born in 1932 and 1934, respectively, and live in Schalchen, Austria.\n\nThe applicants run a fishing farm in Schalchen since 1976. Before that date the parents of the first applicant had run the fishing farm.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1969 the Braunau River Engineering Directorate (Flussbauleitung) carried out regulation works on a small river in the vicinity of the applicants' estate without permission under the Water Act (Wasserrechtsgesetz 1959).\n\nIn October 1969 the former owners of the estate requested the Braunau District Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) to order the Municipalities of Mattighofen and Schalchen (“the Municipalities”) to re-establish the former state of the river bed maintaining that the regulation works had damaged the well which supplied their fishing farm with water. They submitted that the original capacity of the well had been 800 litres of water per second. After the regulation of the river the capacity of the well had been reduced to 100 litres of water per second. This constituted an interference with their water-rights. In case that the regulation could not be reversed they requested that the Municipalities be ordered to take other steps to ensure the water supply of the fishing farm.\n\nOn 14 January 1970 the District Authority dismissed this request.\n\nOn 20 May 1970 the Upper Austria Regional Governor allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the District Authority to decide on the request.\n\nOn 13 January 1971 the applicants' predecessors filed a request for transfer of jurisdiction (Devolutionsantrag) as the District Authority failed to decide within the statutory six months time-limit. On 11 February 1971 the Regional Governor dismissed this request.\n\nOn 3 September 1971 they filed again a request for transfer of jurisdiction and the Regional Governor again dismissed this request. The applicants' predecessors filed an appeal against this decision.\n\nOn 10 February 1972 the Federal Minister for Agriculture and Forestry (Bundesminister für Land- und Forstwirtschaft) allowed the appeal as a consequence of which the Regional Governor had to take a decision on the merits.\n\nOn 8 August 1972 the Regional Governor ordered the Municipalities to ask for an ex post permission of the regulation works which had already been carried out or to re-establish the former state of the river.\n\nOn 23 August 1973 the Federal Minister dismissed the Municipalities' appeal.\n\nSubsequently, on 28 November 1973 the Municipalities applied for an ex post permission. On 3 June 1975 the District Authority held a hearing. At this hearing the applicants' predecessors requested that the Municipalities be ordered to pay compensation as they had suffered prejudice caused by the regulation works.\n\nOn 3 September 1975 the District Authority granted the ex post permission and ordered the Municipalities to take specific steps to ensure the water supply of the fishing farm before 31 December 1976. The District Authority dismissed the request for compensation.\n\nOn 2 December 1975 Regional Governor dismissed the applicants' predecessors' appeal and found that their water rights were not violated by the granted permission.\n\nOn 27 January 1976 the Federal Minister rejected the applicants' predecessors' appeal as belated. Subsequently, they lodged a request for leave to appeal out of time (Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand).\n\nOn 2 April 1976 the Federal Minister granted this request and, consequently, had to take a decision on the merits on the appeal against the Regional Governor's decision of 2 December 1975.\n\nOn 25 November 1976 the ownership on the fishing farm was transferred to the applicants and thereby, they became parties to the proceedings at issue.\n\nOn 5 July 1977 the Federal Minister dismissed the appeal and confirmed the Regional Governor's decision of 2 December 1975.\n\nOn 30 November 1979 the Administrative Court, upon a complaint lodged by the applicants, quashed this decision and found that the administrative authorities had not properly decided whether the applicants' water rights had been prejudiced by the regulation works.\n\nSubsequently, on 19 November 1980, the Federal Minister remitted the case to the Regional Governor and on 15 December 1980 the Regional Governor remitted the case to the District Authority.\n\nOn 28 May 1982 the District Authority granted once more the ex post permission for the regulation works and dismissed the applicants' request for compensation.\n\nOn 28 June 1982 the applicants filed an appeal against this decision. In the years to follow several technical experts were appointed in order to establish whether the regulation works had damaged the well.\n\nOn 11 November 1984, as the District Authority had not taken a decision, the Municipalities filed an application for transfer of jurisdiction (Devolutionsantrag) with the Regional Governor. On 21 January 1985, as also the Regional Governor had not taken a decision, the applicants filed an application for a transfer of jurisdiction with the Federal Minister.\n\nOn 5 December 1987, as the Federal Minister had not taken a decision, the applicants lodged an application against the administrative authorities' failure to decide (Säumnisbeschwerde) with the Administrative Court.\n\nOn 7 January 1988 the Administrative Court ordered the Federal Minister to issue a decision within three months.\n\nOn 22 January 1988 the Federal Minister rejected the applicants' application for transfer of jurisdiction. The applicants lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court against this decision.\n\nOn 3 October 1991 the Administrative Court quashed this decision as a consequence of which the Federal Minister had to take a decision on the merits.\n\nOn 14 October 1996, after having held hearings on 1 and 2 July 1996, the Federal Minister dismissed the applicants appeal. The Minister found that the regulation works had not damaged the applicants' well and dismissed the request for compensation.\n\nThe applicants lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court as well as with the Administrative Court.\n\nOn 13 March 1997 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the applicants' complaint.\n\nOn 6 August 1998 the Administrative Court quashed the Federal Minister's decision of 14 October 1996 on the ground that the Federal Minister had failed to take into account the expert reports submitted by the applicants.\n\nSubsequently, the Federal Minister appointed new technical experts and on 16 July 1999 the Federal Minister served a new expert report on the applicants.\n\nOn 27 October 1999 the applicants filed their comments on the expert report and challenged the experts appointed by the Federal Minister for bias (Ablehnungsantrag).\n\nOn 27 April 2000 the applicants agreed with the Federal Minister on the further conduct of the proceedings. The Federal Minister would furnish a questionnaire to the expert in order that he supplemented his report. Thereafter the applicants would be given the opportunity to comment on the revised report and another hearing would be held.\n\nThe proceedings are still pending.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Johann Achleitner - First applicant, Austrian national born in 1932, runs fishing farm in Schalchen since 1976, became party to proceedings on 25 November 1976", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Johann Achleitner", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "92-93", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Schalchen / Austria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Austria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Fish farmer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Owner", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mrs Christiana Achleitner - Second applicant, Austrian national born in 1934, runs fishing farm in Schalchen since 1976, became party to proceedings on 25 November 1976", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Christiana Achleitner", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "90–91", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Schalchen / Austria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Austria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Fish farmer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "Mr W.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicant arrived in the United Kingdom in 2000 as an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone. Although her asylum claim was refused, she was granted exceptional leave to remain and then, in 2005, indefinite leave to remain. After she obtained indefinite leave to remain, she applied to have her son Mohamed Saliou Jalloh, a Sierra Leonean national born in 1994, join her in the United Kingdom. Her son arrived in January 2007, with conditional leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the condition being that he must not have recourse to public funds. He is considered as being “subject to immigration control” within the meaning of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, as is the applicant (see paragraph 12 below).\n\nAt the time of her son’s arrival in the United Kingdom, the applicant was renting a room in a private home. However, her landlord was unwilling to accommodate her son as well, and informed the applicant shortly after her son’s arrival that they would have to move out by 31 March 2007. The applicant applied to the London Borough of Southwark Council for assistance on 9 February 2007, on the basis that she had become unintentionally homeless. An unintentionally homeless person with a minor child would ordinarily qualify as being in priority need pursuant to section 189 of the Housing Act 1996 (see paragraph 13 below), and would thus be provided with suitable housing, usually within the locality. Those in priority need are considered to be a class of persons to whom reasonable preference must be given in the allocation of social housing. As there is a significant shortage of social housing in London, those in priority need would generally be placed in temporary accommodation until appropriate social housing became available. In the case of the applicant, however, as her son was subject to immigration control, he was disregarded by the Council in the determination of whether the applicant was in priority need, in accordance with section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996. On 14 March 2007 the Council decided that the applicant was not therefore in priority need and not entitled to social housing.\n\nThe applicant requested a review of this decision, which was carried out by a senior officer, who reiterated that persons subject to immigration control are not eligible for housing assistance and that persons who are not eligible for housing assistance shall be disregarded when determining whether another person has a priority need for accommodation. As the applicant’s son was not eligible, the applicant did not have a priority need. Consideration was also given to the question of whether the applicant was vulnerable for any other reason; however, it was found that the applicant was not hindered in the performance of everyday tasks by any medical problems and that she was no less able to fend for herself than the average person. There was therefore no special reason to find that she was entitled to homelessness assistance due to vulnerability. On 24 May 2007 the original decision was upheld.\n\nThe Council assisted the applicant to find a private-sector tenancy in September 2007, which she accepted. The applicant and her son were not therefore at any point actually homeless. However, the private tenancy was more expensive than a social tenancy would have been, and was outside the Borough of Southwark and therefore far from the applicant’s previous employment and her son’s school. The applicant claimed that she had to give up her job after three months of commuting as she was unable to cope with the travel required, and that her son spent four hours per day travelling to and from school.\n\nThe applicant, who had remained on the waiting list for social housing in the Borough of Southwark, obtained an offer of a social tenancy of a one-bedroom flat in March 2009. She and her son therefore moved back to Southwark.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Husenatu Bah - Sierra Leonean national, the applicant who lodged the case against the UK, asylum seeker who arrived in 2000, granted exceptional leave then indefinite leave to remain in 2005", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Husenatu Bah", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Southwark / London / United Kingdom", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Republic of Sierra Leone", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr D.

Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nBy a decision of 4 September 2008 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application. Subsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Kent.\n\nThe applicant and his wife had two children, born in 1982 and 1987. The applicant’s wife died on 2 June 1999.\n\nOn 5 October 2000 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for the payment of social security benefits. He applied for benefits equivalent to those which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow’s Payment (“Wpt”) and a Widowed Mother’s Allowance (“WMA”), payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). On 17 October 2000 his application was rejected as these benefits were only available to women. This decision was reconsidered without alteration on 25 October 2000.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Social Security Tribunal on 10 July 2001 and again his claim was rejected. In November 2001 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the Appeal Commissioner. Eventually permission was granted but his appeal was again rejected on 28 May 2004. The applicant again appealed to the Commissioner who rejected the applicant’s appeal on 13 December 2006.\n\nFinally, the applicant submitted an appeal to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), which was refused on 16 March 2007.\n\nAt the time of his claim in 2000 the applicant was in receipt of child benefit.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr John Blackgrove - British national applicant, born in 1949, lives in Kent, widower with two children who applied for social security benefits", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "John Blackgrove", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "75-76", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Kent / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Widowed", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr C.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 10 July 2001 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. In a letter of 15 July 2003 the Court informed the parties that in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1943 and 1939 respectively and live in Istanbul.\n\nOn 6 September 1993 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways expropriated plots of land belonging to the applicants in Istanbul. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plots of land belonging to the applicants and compensation was paid to them when the expropriation took place.\n\nOn 4 February 1994, following the applicants’ request for increased compensation, the Kartal First Instance Court awarded them additional compensation of 48,410,250,000 Turkish liras (TRL) plus interest at the statutory rate of 30% per annum, namely the rate applicable at the date of the court’s decision. The date, 6 September 1993 was fixed by the domestic court for the running of the statutory rate of interest. The parties appealed.\n\nOn 12 May 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the first instance court. On 2 November 1994 the first instance court re-examined the case and amended the amount of the additional compensation to TRL 45,692,700,000. The decision became final since none of the parties appealed. On 29 December 1997 the administration paid the applicants TRL 95,426,696,000 as the additional compensation together with interest. The interest on the additional compensation was calculated at the statutory rate applicable between the date of the decision of the first instance court in favour of the applicant and 31 December 1997.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1999 the rate of inflation averaged 81.7% per annum.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Ismet Koçak - First applicant, born in 1943, Turkish national living in Istanbul, landowner whose property was expropriated", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Ismet Koçak", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "81-82", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Landowner", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr Hasan Koçak - Second applicant, born in 1939, Turkish national living in Istanbul, landowner whose property was expropriated", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Hasan Koçak", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "85-86", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Landowner", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "Mr Kazım Berzeg - Lawyer practicing in Ankara, legal representative of the applicants", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Kazım Berzeg", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Ankara / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Lawyer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Legal representative", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}]}]}

Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Gdańsk.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 9 August 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud and placed in pre-trial detention. The grounds for this decision are unknown, since the applicant has not produced a copy of it.\n\nOn 3 November 2006 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) extended the applicant’s detention until 9 February 2007. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court further found that there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding, given that earlier he could not be found at his place of permanent residence.\n\nThe applicant submitted that he unsuccessfully appealed against decisions extending his detention.\n\nThe applicant maintained that during his arrest he was treated in a degrading manner by police officers and that he was subjected to threats. On 19 February 2007 the Gdańsk District Prosecutor instituted an investigation into the applicant’s complaints against the police officers. The investigation is still continuing.\n\nB. Censorship of the applicant’s correspondence\n\nThe applicant submitted that during his detention his correspondence was censored by the authorities. He produced five envelopes. All the envelopes bear a stamp that reads: “Censored, date ..., Prosecutor” (Ocenzurowano, dnia ... Prokurator). Those envelopes contained letters from:\n\nthe Penitentiary Association “Patronat” (Stowarzyszenie Penitencjarne “Patronat”), a non-governmental organisation, acting, inter alia, on behalf of prisoners and former prisoners, sent on 30 August 2006;\n\nthe Supreme Court, sent on 26 September 2006;\n\nthe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, sent on 27 September 2006;\n\nthe Ministry of Justice; sent on 27 September 2006;\n\nthe Ombudsman, sent on 28 September 2006.\n\nThe applicant produced one envelope that indicates as the addressee of the letter the Governor of Sztum Prison and bears a stamp that reads: “Censored, date ..., Prosecutor” (Ocenzurowano, dnia ... Prokurator). A hand-written note indicates case file no. IC 119/05.\n\nOne envelope bears traces of having been opened - its sides were cut open and resealed using self-adhesive tape.\n\nThe applicant submitted that a letter addressed to him by the Court had been opened and read by the authorities. In a note sent to the applicant from Sztum Prison (Zakład Karny) on 21 December 2006, he was informed that on 29 November 2006 a letter from the European Court of Human Rights to the applicant had been delivered by the District Prosecutor’s Office.

Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 19 January 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1925 and 1927, respectively, and live in Lublin, Poland.\n\nOn 21 May 1993 the applicants' neighbours were granted a permission to construct a shop on the ground floor of their house. The applicants appealed but the decision was upheld on 19 July 1993.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1994 the applicants applied to have the decision declared null and void. They submitted that the decision had been issued in violation of the local zoning plan and that the shop had been causing them nuisance.\n\nOn 11 April 1994 the Minister of Planning (Minister Gospodarki Przestrzennej i Budownictwa) dismissed their application. The applicants appealed.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the Chief Building Inspector (Główny Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego) allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned decision.\n\nThe Chief Building Inspector informed the applicants in his letters of 30 December 1995, 30 January, 28 February and 26 March 1996 that the proceedings could not be terminated yet and that he had fixed new time-limits. The Inspector explained that the main reason for the delay had been the necessity to obtain an expert opinion, which had been ultimately submitted on 9 April 1996.\n\nOn 18 April 1996 the Chief Building Inspector refused to annul the decision of 21 May 1993. The Inspector informed the applicants that the decision was final and that they could lodge a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny).\n\nOn 4 June 1996 the first applicant lodged a complaint against the decision with the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\nOn 23 April 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court held a hearing and rejected the applicant's complaint as it had been lodged in breach of procedural requirements. The court established that the applicant should have first lodged an appeal with the Chief Building Inspector asking him to reconsider the case. The court further advised the applicant that since the procedural mistake had occurred due to his being wrongly advised by the Inspector in the decision of 18 April 1996, he could apply for leave to appeal out of time.\n\nOn 25 May 1998 the first applicant appealed to the Inspector to reconsider the case and applied for leave to lodge an appeal out of time.\n\nOn 4 June 1998 the Chief Building Inspector granted leave to appeal out of time, examined the appeal, and upheld his decision of 18 April 1996.\n\nOn 30 September 1998 the first applicant lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court against the decision of 4 June 1998.\n\nOn 5 October 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the complaint.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Zdzisław Olesiński - First applicant, born in 1925, Polish national living in Lublin, lodged complaints with the Supreme Administrative Court", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Zdzisław Olesiński", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "99-100", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Lublin / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mrs Helena Olesińska - Second applicant, born in 1927, Polish national living in Lublin", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Helena Olesińska", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "97-98", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Lublin / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "Mr J.

Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicant was born in 1967 and, at the time of lodging his application with the Court, was serving a sentence of imprisonment in HM Prison Ranby, Nottinghamshire.\n\nIn October 1995, in response to an increase in the availability of heroin in Bradford, the police commenced “Operation Trafalgar”, to identify and target those responsible. On the basis of intelligence reports the police reached the conclusion that the applicant was the head of a group of Asian drug traffickers operating in the area. Video recordings made of his house and his itemised telephone bill indicated that he was in regular contact with suspected drug dealers from elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 17 July 1996, in accordance with Home Office Guidelines (“the Guidelines”: see paragraphs 16-18 of the Khan judgment, cited in paragraph 12 below) the Chief Constable authorised the use of a covert listening device in the applicant’s house. On 19 July 1996 the applicant was arrested for suspected car theft and a warrant was obtained to search his house for documents relating to motor vehicles. When executing the warrant the police covertly installed listening and recording equipment inside his house. Recordings were made between 19 July and 21 November 1996. The Chief Constable’s authorisation had been obtained for the entire period, except 16 August and 6 September, when the authorisation had lapsed and not been renewed, due to an oversight.\n\nIt was the prosecution’s case at the subsequent trial that the recordings obtained in this way revealed detailed discussions between the applicant and his co-accused demonstrating their involvement in conspiracies to import and distribute Class A drugs, in particular heroin.\n\nThe applicant was arrested, together with a number of alleged associates, and charged with conspiracy to import and supply Class A drugs. He and his co-accused applied to have the prosecution struck out for abuse of process and/or the recordings excluded from evidence. On 14 January 1999 the trial judge ruled against the defendants, observing as follows: “I respectfully note the conclusion of the European Commission of Human rights in the case of Michael Govell v. the United Kingdom, adopted 14 January 1998, to the effect that the use of covert listening devices in accordance with the Guidelines is not done in accordance with the law and is thus in breach of Article 8, because in the United Kingdom there is as yet no legally binding publicly accessible body of law regulating such activity. I bear in mind that the Convention is not yet part of our law, but that where possible domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with Convention principles. I take into account that in intruding on the privacy of Elahi’s home the police will have committed civil trespass and possibly criminal damage. I take into account that there may have been conduct outside the Home Office Guidelines, in that the authority for the continued use of the listening device may not have been in place between 16 August and 6 September. On the other hand, I bear in mind my finding that the police followed the Guidelines to the letter in all other respects and did not intend deliberately to circumvent the requirement to obtain the Chief Constable’s authority. I take into account that the police acted in good faith throughout in pursuit of the public good in the detection and prosecution of very serious crime. Balancing these factors, I’m satisfied that there is no evidence of abuse of power by the police which could found the basis for a stay of the proceedings as being an abuse of process. ... I turn next to consider the court’s exclusionary power under s. 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. ... Being in tape recorded form there’s unlikely to be dispute about [the evidence’s] authenticity. It is highly relevant and potentially probative of the defendants’ involvement in the conspiracies alleged. It did not result from incitement, entrapment or inducements, or other conduct of that sort. The fact that the defendants may not have said what they did if they’d known the police were listening in does not mean that reception of evidence of what they said is unfair. The potential branches of the civil or criminal law and Article 8 and the possible lack of the Chief Constable’s authority between certain dates do not affect the quality of the evidence ...”\n\nFollowing this ruling, the applicant absconded. He was convicted in his absence on 27 August 1999, and sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment.\n\nIt appears that the applicant was arrested some years later, at which point he appealed against conviction, arguing that the covertly obtained recordings should not have been used at trial and that he had made the damaging recorded statements only because he had been entrapped into so doing by participating informants. His renewed application was rejected by the full Court of Appeal on 25 May 2004, on the grounds that the trial judge’s ruling of 14 January 1999 was irreproachable and that there was no evidence of entrapment or any other abusive action on the part of the police.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Ashiq Hussain Elahi - British national applicant, born in 1967, convicted drug trafficker sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, served time in HM Prison Ranby", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Ashiq Hussain Elahi", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "57-58", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "HM Prison Ranby / Nottinghamshire / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr B.

The applicant was represented by Mr M. N. Eldem, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 15 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1980 and lives in Kayseri, was a student at a military academy. At the time of his registration at this academy, his father had signed a promissory note for the reimbursement of the applicant’s educational expenses in the event of his leaving the school, due to expulsion or otherwise.\n\nIn March 2003 the applicant was expelled from the military academy following a secret security investigation conducted by the Ministry of Defence into him and his family. The applicant was not notified of the specific reasons for his expulsion.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant asked the Supreme Military Administrative Court to annul the expulsion decision. During the proceedings, he did not have access to the classified documents and information submitted by the Ministry of Defence to the Supreme Military Administrative Court in support of its decision to expel him from the military academy.\n\nOn 10 December 2003 the Supreme Military Administrative Court refused to annul the expulsion decision. It stated that information and documents the confidentiality of which was required and necessitated for the performance of military service could not be disclosed to the applicant. The Court further emphasised that it was not bound by the classification made by the administration and that it made its own assessment as to whether the confidentiality of the documents was justified in each case. The written opinion submitted by the principal public prosecutor to the Supreme Military Administrative Court during the proceedings was not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 7 April 2004 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s rectification request, which decision was served on the applicant on 20 April 2004.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence subsequently filed an action with the Kayseri Civil Court against the applicant for the reimbursement of his educational expenses. On 3 May 2004 the Kayseri Civil Court ordered the applicant to pay the Ministry of Defence 5,050,500,000 Turkish liras (TRL) (approximately 3,000 euros (EUR)), plus interest running from 8 April 2003.\n\nII.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-5d274", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31834/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hasan Yağız (“the applicant”), on 4 June 1996.\n\nThe applicant did not appoint a lawyer for his representation. The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Tukey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nThe President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaints (applications nos. 26480/95, 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 32964/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 § 2).\n\nBy a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties’ observations, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Arrest and detention of the applicant\n\nOn 17 April 1985 police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).\n\nOn 6 February 1985 the Ankara Martial Law Court (sıkıyönetim mahkemesi) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.\n\nB. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1985 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code. It was further decided that this indictment should be joined to the indictment of 26 February 1982 lodged against 722 other Dev-Yol defendants.\n\nOn 11 May 1988 the Ankara Martial Law Court ordered the applicant’s release pending trial.\n\nIn a judgment of 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant on account of his involvement in the Dev-Yol. It sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment under Article 146 § 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code.\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Military Court of Cassation (askeri yargıtay).\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 26 December 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.\n\nOn 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the above judgment.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Hasan Yağız -

Akyazıcı, a lawyer practising in Samsun. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 1 February 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, an anaesthesiologist, was born in 1968 and lives in Samsun.\n\nThe applicant was working at the Kars State Hospital when criminal proceedings were instigated against him for alleged involvement in the activities of an illegal organisation. He was accused together with other suspects of, inter alia, hanging posters and banners in various places in Ankara on behalf of that organisation. Throughout the proceedings the applicant maintained his innocence. In the meantime, Kars State Hospital suspended the applicant pending the criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 11 September 2001 the Ankara State Security Court, on the basis of the evidence contained in the case file, convicted the applicant under Article 7 § 1 of Law no. 3713 and sentenced him to two years and six months' imprisonment and to a fine. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn an unspecified date a written opinion of the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation dated 10 December 2001 was submitted to that court. This opinion was not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 27 March 2002 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in respect of the applicant.\n\nThe applicant's request for a rectification of the Court of Cassation's judgment was dismissed by the principal public prosecutor at that court.\n\nThe applicant submitted that he had been released from prison in July 2003.\n\nBy an additional judgment dated 4 May 2004, the Ankara State Security Court, taking into account the amendment to the definition of “terror acts” under section 7 of Law no. 3713 pursuant to Law no. 4928, acquitted the applicant, who had not taken part in any violent activities, and nullified his conviction, together with all its consequences. This judgment became final on 11 May 2004.\n\nIn the meantime, on 28 February 2002, the Supreme Disciplinary Commission of the Ministry of Health decided to dismiss the applicant from the civil service. The applicant's objection to this decision was dismissed by the administrative court who noted, inter alia, that, according to the disciplinary investigation, the applicant had taken fifteen days leave from 2 June 2000 in pursuit of his illegal activities. The court also noted that the applicant's conviction had become final. This decision was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court on 27 December 2005. In his observations the applicant submitted that, despite his acquittal, his request for a retrial had been rejected by the administrative court. However, he did not submit any court decisions.\n\nAccording to an attestation dated 10 September 2007 the applicant is currently employed at Atasam hospital in Samsun.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Tuğrul Akyazıcı - Turkish national applicant, anaesthesiologist born in 1968, lives in Samsun, worked at Kars State Hospital, convicted and later acquitted of involvement in illegal organization activities, dismissed from civil service, currently employed at Atasam hospital", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Tuğrul Akyazıcı", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "56-57", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Samsun / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Anaesthesiologist", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Atasam hospital", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr M.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-6e1f3", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 21413/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Yash Pal Kansal (“the applicant”), on 21 May 2002.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A. Barone, a solicitor practising in Bovington. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nInsofar as the case was declared admissible, the applicant alleged that the statements obtained under compulsion in bankruptcy proceedings should not have been admitted in criminal proceedings against him. He invoked Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 28 January 2003, the Court communicated the applicant's complaint about self-incrimination to the respondent Government and declared inadmissible the remainder of the application. By a decision of 23 September 2003, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant but not the Government filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Oldham.\n\nFrom 1977, the applicant ran a company which operated 20 chemist shops. Following financial problems, the company went into liquidation in February 1987. On 20 May 1987, a bankruptcy petition was presented against the applicant and on 11 March 1988, a bankruptcy order was made.\n\nOn 29 July 1988, the applicant was publicly examined by the official receiver. Under section 291 of the Insolvency Act 1986, the applicant was obliged to answer the questions put to him by the official receiver and if he failed to comply without reasonable excuse, he would have been guilty of contempt of court and liable to punishment by a fine or imprisonment.\n\nOn 16 March and 23 March 1988, a building society advanced 150,000 pounds sterling (GBP) and GBP 116,250 respectively to the applicant. On 23 March 1988, the applicant's wife collected part of the advance, GBP 104,000, and took it to India in a bin liner.\n\nThe applicant was subsequently charged with two offences of obtaining property by deception contrary to section 15(1) of the Theft Act 1968 on the grounds that he had misled the building society into advancing money by false representations regarding his income, his debts and the bankruptcy proceedings against him. He was also charged with two offences of removing property required to be delivered to the official receiver and failing to account for the loss of property while bankrupt contrary to section 354(2) and (3) of the Insolvency Act 1986.\n\nAt the applicant's trial in February 1992, the prosecution introduced as evidence the transcript of the examination of the applicant by the official receiver in the bankruptcy proceedings. The applicant submitted that the transcript was inadmissible under section 31 of the Theft Act 1968 which provides that a statement or admission made by a person answering questions in proceedings for the administration of any property or for an account of any property or dealings with property is not admissible in evidence against that person. However, the trial judge ruled the evidence admissible under section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 which provided that statements made in pursuance of a requirement imposed by the Act could be used in evidence against the maker of the statement. The full transcript was placed before the jury and in his summing up, the judge stated that the transcript “could be very important”.\n\nOn 18 February 1992, the applicant was convicted of the four offences charged and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. The applicant appealed against conviction and on 12 May 1992, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal deciding, inter alia, that the transcript of the bankruptcy examination was admissible under section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 which abrogated the privilege against self-incrimination. Leave to appeal was refused by the Court of Appeal and by the House of Lords.\n\nOn 27 June 1995, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain decided to remove the applicant's licence to practise as a pharmacist on the grounds of unfitness due to his involvement in the deception connected with his bankruptcy proceedings and a previous reprimand relating to the cleanliness of his premises.\n\nOn 27 April 1998, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”) referred the applicant's case back to the Court of Appeal due to changes in the domestic law on obtaining mortgage advances by false statements. On 20 June 2000, the Commission added the ground that, following the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Saunders v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI) and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998, the admission of answers given under compulsion during the bankruptcy examination may have been in breach of Article 6 of the Convention and rendered the applicant's conviction unsafe.\n\nOn 24 May 2001, the Court of Appeal overturned the applicant's conviction on the grounds that the answers given by the applicant in his examination by the official receiver had been wrongly admitted at trial and in breach of Article 6 of the Convention. The court found that the Human Rights Act 1998 could apply retrospectively. It certified a point of law to the House of Lords as to whether the Human Rights Act 1998 could apply retrospectively in appeals arising from a reference by the CCRC.\n\nThe Crown appealed to the House of Lords against the decision of the Court of Appeal. On 29 November 2001, the House of Lords allowed the appeal, holding that they were bound to follow the earlier decision of the House in R v. Lambert [2001] 3 WLR 206, which had decided that the Human Rights Act 1998 could not apply retrospectively to allow a defendant whose trial took place before the Act came into force to rely on a breach of the Convention in a later appeal.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Yash Pal Kansal - The applicant, United Kingdom national born in 1947, lives in Oldham, ran a company with 20 chemist shops, went bankrupt, convicted of fraud offenses and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Yash Pal Kansal", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "77-78", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Oldham / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-c0ef8", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24254/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Tomasz Kwiatkowski (“the applicant”), on 24 June 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, inter alia, that the lustration proceedings in his case had been unfair, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 8 October 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Konstancin‑Jeziorna.\n\nOn 11 April 1997 the parliament passed the Law on disclosing work for or service in the State’s security services or collaboration with them between 1944 and 1990 by persons exercising public functions (ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub służby w organach bezpieczeństwa państwa lub współpracy z nimi w latach 1944‑1990 osób pełniących funkcje publiczne; “the 1997 Lustration Act”). It entered into force on 3 August 1997. Persons falling under the provisions of the 1997 Lustration Act, i.e. candidates or holders of public office such as ministers and members of parliament, were required to declare whether or not they had worked for or collaborated with the security services during the communist regime. The provisions of the Act extended to, inter alia, judges, prosecutors and advocates.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant, who was an advocate, declared that he had not collaborated with the communist‑era secret services.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 2000 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) decided to institute lustration proceedings against the applicant following a request made by the Commissioner of the Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego) on the grounds that the applicant had lied in his lustration declaration by denying that he had co‑operated with the secret services.\n\nOn 27 June 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the first‑instance lustration court, found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration. The operative part of the judgment was served on the applicant. However, the reasoning was considered “secret” and, in accordance with Article 100 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, could only be consulted in the secret registry of that court.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal in which he maintained, in particular, that his rights had been breached because he could not freely consult the reasoning of the judgment.\n\nOn 16 May 2003 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the second‑instance lustration court, upheld the impugned judgment.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal as being manifestly ill‑founded. The applicant was removed from the Bar Association with the result that he is unable to practise as an advocate for a period of ten years in application of the 1997 Lustration Act.\n\nThe judgment was notified to the applicant’s representative on 17 January 2005.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Tomasz Kwiatkowski - Polish national applicant, born in 1948, lives in Konstancin-Jeziorna, advocate who was subject to lustration proceedings and removed from the Bar Association", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Tomasz Kwiatkowski", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "76-77", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Konstancin-Jeziorna / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 5}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Lawyer", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr J.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 12 September 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Antalya.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nOn 7 October 1999 the applicant was taken into custody for his suspected involvement in terrorist activities. On the same date the Magistrates' Court of Antalya ordered his detention pending trial.\n\nAt a hearing held on 25 November 1999, the State Security Court of Izmir ordered the applicant's release.\n\nOn 29 June 2000 he was acquitted of all charges.\n\nOn 10 August 2000 he applied to the Antalya Assize Court, seeking compensation pursuant to Law no. 466. That Law provides, inter alia, for an award of damages to any person who has been unlawfully deprived of his or her liberty, or who, after being lawfully detained, was not subsequently committed for trial or was acquitted after standing trial.\n\nThe applicant claimed a total of 6,050,000,000 Turkish Liras (TRL) in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, comprising lost wages as a construction worker, legal costs and fees and moral damages.\n\nOn 13 June 2002 the court handed down a judgment awarding the applicant an unspecified sum of money.\n\nUpon separate appeals by the applicant as well as the Treasury, the Court of Cassation quashed that ruling on 12 May 2003 and remitted the file to the Antalya Assize Court for a more comprehensive examination.\n\nThe assize court resumed the proceedings by broadening the scope of its examination of the damage which the applicant had suffered. On 23 September 2003 the court gave a second judgment, which the Court of Cassation quashed on 18 October 2004. Once again the Court of Cassation directed the court to conduct a more thorough research into the applicant's entitlement to damages.\n\nOn 18 February 2005 the assize court handed down its third ruling, awarding the applicant 781 New Turkish liras.0 The parties appealed separately.\n\nThe applicant learned through his verbal contacts with the assize court's registry that on 6 February 2006 the Court of Cassation had upheld the latter judgment with certain rectifications.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Ali Erden - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1950, lives in Antalya, was detained on suspicion of terrorist activities, later acquitted and sought compensation", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Ali Erden", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "74-75", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Antalya / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Construction worker", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms T.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-97e8f", "number_of_subjects": 2, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36619/03) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Lars Wassdahl (“the applicant”), on 8 November 2003.\n\nThe Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr M. Falk, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 November 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the administrative proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Orsa.\n\nOn 28 May 1996 the Tax Authority (skattemyndigheten) of the County of Kopparberg sent a preliminary consideration (övervägande) to the applicant informing him that it was considering disallowing the deduction he had made for the interest he had paid on debts in the amount of 2,000,000 Swedish kronor (SEK), as well as his declared capital gains for the sale of stocks in the amount of SEK 775,000, that he had made in his tax return for 1995. Further, it was considering imposing tax surcharges (skattetillägg) amounting to SEK 147,000 (approximately 15,800 euros [EUR]), i.e. 40% of the increased tax liability on the sum of SEK 1,225,000.\n\nThe preliminary consideration was based on an investigation of a company which had done business with a substantial number of private persons. As concerned the applicant, it appeared that he had borrowed SEK 40,000,000 from the company and commissioned it to buy stocks for the same amount on his behalf. The applicant then sold the stocks back to the company at a fixed date, upon which he had made a capital gain. At the same time, he repaid the loan together with interest to the company. As the capital gain corresponded to the interest, they were set off against each other. In the Tax Authority’s view, the transactions had in reality never taken place and the applicant had simply received two statements of account and a promissory note in order to use them to obtain tax advantages.\n\nThe applicant was requested to submit any comments he might have to the Tax Authority by 22 July 1996, which he did. He claimed that the transactions had taken place and that his tax return should be approved.\n\nOn 27 September 1996 the Tax Authority decided to follow its preliminary consideration. With regard to the imposition of tax surcharges, it found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information about the purported transactions.\n\nOn 3 January 1997 the applicant appealed against the decision, disputing the Tax Authority’s findings. He maintained that there were no grounds for disallowing the deductions or imposing tax surcharges on him.\n\nOn 30 April 1997 the Tax Authority made its obligatory re-assessment of its decision of 27 September 1996 but upheld it. It then forwarded the appeal to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Dalarna.\n\nOn 29 May 2000 the County Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal after having held an oral hearing. It agreed with the Tax Authority’s conclusion that no transactions had in reality taken place between the applicant and the company, for which reason they could not be included in his tax return. Moreover, the court found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information to the Tax Authority and that there were no grounds on which to remit the tax surcharges.\n\nOn 30 June 2000 the applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Sundsvall, maintaining his claims. On 30 January 2002 he made further submissions to the court, stating inter alia that his rights under Article 6 of the Convention had been violated as he had not had access to the same material as the Tax Authority, and since the tax surcharges had been incorrectly imposed on him.\n\nBy judgment of 15 April 2002 the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full, without giving any new reasons of its own.\n\nOn 27 May 2002 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten), relying on the same grounds as before the lower courts and expanding them further.\n\nOn 11 September 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.\n\nOn 25 November 2003 the applicant sued the Swedish State, through the Chancellor of Justice, before the District Court (tingsrätten) in Stockholm. He sought SEK 6,850,000 (approximately EUR 736,000) in damages on the grounds that the Tax Authority and the administrative courts had not afforded him a fair procedure, having withheld certain information from him, and that the proceedings had been of excessive length. He invoked national legislation as well as the Convention and its case-law.\n\nThe State contested the suit, claiming that it had not caused the applicant any injury, either by fault or neglect, for which he could claim damages.\n\nIn a judgment of 21 December 2004, the District Court rejected the applicant’s claims. As concerned the length of the proceedings, the court considered that the administrative courts’ examination of his tax case had not taken so long as to incur the State’s liability for damages.\n\nOn 27 December 2004 the applicant appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (hovrätten), maintaining his claims.\n\nOn 2 November 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full. With regard to the complaint about the length of the proceedings, the court, without giving any reasons, found that the tax proceedings could not be considered to have been of excessive duration.\n\nOn 12 October 2005 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) where the case is still pending, awaiting a decision on leave to appeal.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Lars Wassdahl - Swedish national born in 1947, lives in Orsa, the applicant in this case who disputed tax authority decisions regarding deductions and capital gains", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Lars Wassdahl", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "77-78", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Orsa / Sweden", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Sweden", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr M.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-a3d8f", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 71665/01) against the French Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a French national, Ms Gisèle Augusto (“the applicant”), on 31 August 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Lyon-Caen, a lawyer practising in Paris. The French Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr R. Abraham, then by his successor, Ms E. Belliard, Director of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 18 November 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Vouziers.\n\nBy a decision of 17 May 1996 the occupational counselling and redeployment board (“the COTOREP”) gave the applicant a 50 to 79% disability rating and issued her with a card certifying that she found it difficult to remain in a standing position.\n\nOn 6 August 1996, the regional health insurance fund (“the CRAM”) for the North-East region rejected the applicant’s request for a retirement pension as of 1 June 1996 on the basis of her incapacity to work, on the ground that she was not at least 50% disabled.\n\nOn 13 December 1996 the disability claims tribunal upheld the CRAM’s decision.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the national tribunal for claims relating to disability and level of insurance coverage for accidents at work (“the CNITAAT”), submitting a number of medical certificates attesting to her state of health and relying on the COTOREP’s decision of 17 May 1996.\n\nIn a decision of 24 November 1997, the CNITAAT upheld the decision of the disability claims tribunal, stating the following reasons: “The rate of disability comprised between 50% and 79% acknowledged for the purposes of issuing the card certifying that it is “difficult to remain in a standing position” is not calculated using the same assessment criteria as the rate applicable in the present case, so this ground of appeal cannot be upheld; The accredited doctor of the national tribunal for claims relating to disability and level of insurance coverage for accidents at work observes the following: ‘The subject shows signs of preexisting injuries: fracture of the 4th sacral vertebra in 1965, fracture of the left kneecap that was pinned and wired in 1990, fracture of the lower right tibia in 1994. No after-effects in the region of the sacrum are mentioned. The left knee is slightly limited in flexion and shows mild gonarthrosis, and there is lateral calcification of the patella. No after-effects in the left ankle are reported. There is arthrosis of the whole spinal column, with degenerative discopathy at L5‑S1. It is mild arthrosis, not unusual at the subject’s age, with only a slight loss of flexibility of the different segments of the spine. Episodic onsets of sciatica and cervico‑brachial neuralgia are reported in the case history. There are no signs of herniated lumbar disk . There is calcifying periarthritis of the left shoulder, but it does not restrict movement. The same applies to the arthrosis at the base of the right thumb.’ He concludes that: ‘On 1 June 1996 the subject was in a fit state to carry on working without seriously jeopardising her health and, considering her physical and mental fitness for work, did not suffer from a permanent incapacity to work of at least 50%’; In the light of the above medical opinion, the documents in the file and the criteria laid down in Articles L. 351-7 and R. 351‑21 of the Social Security Code, the national tribunal for claims relating to disability and level of insurance coverage for accidents at work decides to uphold the impugned decision ...”\n\nThe applicant lodged a notice of appeal on points of law on 27 May 1998. In further pleadings her lawyer filed with the Court of Cassation on 23 October 1998, she invoked, inter alia, a violation of “the requirements of the rights of the defence” and of “equality of arms in a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6” of the Convention, in that the report by the CNITAAT’s accredited doctor, drawn up solely on the basis of documents, had not been made available to her or to the doctor she had appointed to submit observations.\n\nBy a judgment of 2 March 2000 the Employment and Welfare Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal in the following terms: “... on the one hand, the accredited doctor instructed, under the terms of Article R. 143‑28 of the Social Security Code then in force, to carry out a preliminary review of the case, simply gives an opinion to the national disability tribunal without submitting an expert report for adversarial discussion by the parties; Without laying itself open to the objection raised in the ground of appeal, the national disability tribunal, in the light of the findings of its accredited doctor and having analysed the different evidence adduced, considered, as it was within its exclusive jurisdiction to do, that Ms Augusto’s disability rate – the COTOREP evaluation of which was not binding on it – was less than 50%, and that the applicant was therefore not entitled to a retirement pension on the ground of incapacity to work; For these reasons, the appeal ... is dismissed.”", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Gisèle Augusto - The applicant, French national born in 1936, lives in Vouziers, seeking retirement pension based on disability", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Gisèle Augusto", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "88-89", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Vouziers / France", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "France", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Retired", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-b8d47", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 26718/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Uğur Çatak (“the applicant”), on 13 July 2005. The applicant was represented by Mr Ç. Bingölbalı, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 4 March 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1985 and lives in İzmir, was a student at a military academy. When he registered with the academy, the applicant and his father had signed a promissory note for the reimbursement of the applicant's educational expenses in the event of his leaving the school, due to expulsion or otherwise.\n\nOn 7 June 2004 the applicant was expelled from the military academy following a secret security investigation conducted by the Ministry of Defence into him and his family. The applicant was not notified of the specific reasons for his expulsion.\n\nOn 23 July 2004 the applicant asked the Supreme Military Administrative Court to annul the expulsion decision.\n\nOn 23 August 2004 the Ministry of Defence made submissions to the Supreme Military Administrative Court, alleging that the applicant had been expelled in compliance with the relevant laws. The Ministry of Defence also supplied that court with the results of the security investigation which had led to the applicant's expulsion in support of its allegations. The applicant was not granted access to this information, as it was classified as secret, in accordance with Article 52 (4) of Law no. 1602 on the Supreme Military Administrative Court.\n\nFollowing an examination of the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence, on 15 December 2004 the Supreme Military Administrative Court refused to annul the expulsion decision. The court acknowledged that the security investigation conducted into the applicant and his family had revealed that his father had previously been convicted of forgery. It further held that this information justified the applicant's expulsion under the relevant laws and regulations.\n\nOn 18 January 2005 the applicant requested rectification of that judgment, which the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected on 16 February 2005.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence subsequently filed an action with the İzmir Civil Court against the applicant for the reimbursement of his educational expenses. On 14 April 2008 the İzmir Civil Court ordered the applicant to pay the Ministry of Defence 12,355.61 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 6,000 euros (EUR)), plus interest running from 7 June 2004.\n\nII. RELEVANT LAW\n\nA description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the decision of Karayiğit v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 45874/05, 23 September 2008). In particular, Article 52 of Law no. 1602 on the Supreme Military Administrative Court provides as follows: “The Chambers ... may request the parties or the competent authorities to provide them with all documents and information concerning the cases before them ... ... Nonetheless, the Prime Minister, the Army Commander-in-Chief or the competent Minister may refuse to submit the requested documents or information if they concern the security or superior interests of the Republic of Turkey ... on condition of disclosing the reasons. ... the confidential documents requested by the Chamber ..., as well as the [confidential] documents submitted by the Administration ...cannot be the object of an examination by the parties or their representatives ...”", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Uğur Çatak - Turkish national applicant, born in 1985, lives in İzmir, expelled from military academy following security investigation", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Uğur Çatak", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "39-40", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "İzmir / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "High School Diploma", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr Ç.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-054e0", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38399/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Józef Polejowski (“the applicant”), on 18 June 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been deprived of his right of access to a court, contrary to Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 1 September 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Miechucino, Poland.\n\nIn 1992 the applicant donated his agricultural property to his son. In 1996 the public notary prepared an amendment to the contract concerning the transfer of certain items of property (agricultural equipment) to the applicant's son. On 24 June 1997 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) confirmed that the amendment was invalid.\n\nOn 5 July 2001 the applicant sued his son, J.P., before the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) for restitution of the items of property in question. The applicant indicated that the value of the claim was almost 200,000 Polish zlotys (PLN). He also asked to be exempted from court fees.\n\nOn 18 September 2001 the Regional Court refused to exempt the applicant from court fees. The court gave the following reasons for its decision: “The applicant submitted that his only income was a disability pension in the amount of PLN 552.21 [approx. EUR 138]. He further claimed that he did not own any real estate or any other assets, except for a car. However, he had been paying for it in instalments: PLN 159.50 [approx. EUR 40] monthly. The plaintiff estimated the amount of his monthly expenses for his flat at PLN 200 [EUR 50]. From the documents submitted by the applicant it appears that the sum he spends monthly on his flat, and the loan for the car customised for a disabled person, amounts to PLN 359.5. After he pays for the flat and the loan, the plaintiff has PLN 192.5 left [approx. EUR 48]. According to the court, it is not enough to cover his maintenance costs such as food, clothes and medication... This leads the court to the conclusion that the plaintiff has other additional resources and he can afford to pay the court fees in question. Consequently, considering that the plaintiff failed to indicate all his assets, the court dismisses his application for an exemption from court fees.”\n\nOn 30 October 2001 the applicant filed an interlocutory appeal against this decision. He also filed a new motion for an exemption from court fees.\n\nThe Gdańsk Regional Court rejected the applicant's interlocutory appeal as it had been lodged outside the prescribed time-limit. On 19 April 2002 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal upheld this decision.\n\nOn 21 May 2002 the Regional Court ordered the applicant to supplement his motion for an exemption from court fees.\n\nIn reply the applicant stressed that his financial situation had not changed and was still very bad. His disability benefit had increased by PLN 2, as shown by a pay slip he had attached.\n\nOn 17 June 2002 the Gdańsk Regional Court rejected the applicant's second motion for exemption from court fees. The court held that it had already considered the applicant's financial situation and found that it had not justified an exemption.\n\nThe applicant filed an interlocutory appeal. He submitted that he was 63 years old and in poor health. He was not even able to buy the necessary medication as his monthly disability pension amounted to PLN 556. For these reasons he believed that he should be exempted from court fees.\n\nOn 16 October 2002 the Gdansk Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's interlocutory appeal against this decision. The court repeated the reasons given by the Regional Court.\n\nOn 12 November 2002 the Regional Court ordered the applicant to pay PLN 11,305.5 [approx. EUR 2,826] for lodging his statement of claim on pain of having it returned.\n\nAs the applicant failed to do so, his statement of claim was returned to him on 3 February 2003.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Józef Polejowski - Polish national applicant born in 1939, lives in Miechucino, Poland, donated property to his son in 1992, receives disability pension, filed lawsuit against his son for restitution", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Józef Polejowski", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "85-86", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Miechucino / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr J.

On 22 November 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Gülizar Tuncer Güneş - Turkish national born in 1966, lawyer living in Istanbul, the applicant who sought to use only her maiden name after marriage", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Gülizar Tuncer Güneş", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "58-59", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Istanbul / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms K.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-923b5", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 68103/01) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Karsten Trippel (“the applicant”), on 12 March 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by C. Lenz, a lawyer practising in Stuttgart. The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Stoltenberg, Ministerialdirigent, Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicant complained, inter alia, that the length of the court proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court exceeded a reasonable time within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 14 March 2002 the Third Section declared the application partly inadmissible.\n\nOn 20 March 2003, the Third Section declared the applicant's complaint about the length of the proceedings admissible. The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant lives in Großbottwar, Germany.\n\nHe owned four shares in a company, the MotoMeter AG. 99 % of this company's shares were held by the company Robert Bosch GmbH.\n\nOn 6 July 1992, following a majority decision of the shareholders' meeting, the MotoMeter AG sold all its company assets to a newly founded company, the MotoMeter GmbH, and was subsequently liquidated. The majority shareholder offered to buy the minority shareholders' shares at a price of 615 DEM (314.44 EUR) per share.\n\nOn 22 July 1992, the applicant and other private shareholders challenged the decision of 6 July 1992 before the Stuttgart Regional Court. They submitted that the main shareholder had circumvented rules aiming at the protection of minority shareholders inherent in the German Act on Stock Companies (Aktiengesetz). They further complained that the price per share offered by the main shareholder was too low and that minority shareholders had not been able to buy parts of the assets.\n\nOn 22 January 1993, the Regional Court rejected the claim on the grounds that the decision in question was lawful and that there had been no violation of the applicant's and other shareholders' rights.\n\nOn 21 December 1993, the Stuttgart Court of Appeal rejected the appeals lodged by the applicant and the other minority shareholders.\n\nOn 5 December 1994, the Federal Court of Justice refused to entertain their appeals on points of law.\n\nOn 12 January 1995, the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court.\n\nOn 23 August 2000 (served on 13 September 2000), the Federal Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicant's complaint, finding that the complaint was not of fundamental constitutional significance. Referring to an earlier decision of the same day dealing with a similar subject matter, which it attached, the Federal Constitutional Court noted that entertaining the complaint was not necessary in order to enforce the applicant's rights. Finally, as the applicant had only possessed four shares of the MotoMeter AG, his financial loss had not posed an existential burden for him.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Karsten Trippel - German national applicant living in Großbottwar, Germany, owned four shares in MotoMeter AG, filed the application against Germany", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Karsten Trippel", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Großbottwar / Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "C.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-00ad1", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 50034/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Olubukunola Obasa (“the applicant”), on 30 April 1999.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Pedro Emmanuel Solicitors, lawyers practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the proceedings in which she claimed discrimination at work took an unreasonable length of time contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 30 November 2000, the Court declared part of the application inadmissible and adjourned examination of the complaints relating to length of proceedings.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section. By a decision of 15 November 2001, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations concerning the issue of just satisfaction. The Court decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant, Olubukunola Obasa, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1961 and lives in Wellingborough.\n\nThe applicant commenced employment as a social worker with the London Borough of Islington (“the Council”) on 4 September 1989. In April 1991, she submitted a formal complaint to the Council's principal Equal Opportunities Officers alleging inter alia harassment and refusal of a promotion on grounds of race. She was interviewed by investigating officers in October 1991.\n\nOn 9 December 1991, the applicant presented an originating application to the Employment Tribunal alleging that she had been discriminated against as a black woman with a disability, inter alia, due to the decision to give a promotion to another employee instead of herself, the failure to transfer her to another post and the failure to assign her to a higher grade by giving due recognition to her professional qualifications. In her application, she relied on events going back to the commencement of her employment in 1989.\n\nOn 23 January 1992, one of the Council's investigating officers informed the applicant that her complaints had been found to be unsubstantiated. The applicant sought to appeal the rejection of her complaints pursuant to the Council's internal grievance procedure.\n\nThe Employment Tribunal held a hearing on 9 June 1992, at which the parties agreed that under section 68(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976, which required that complaints be presented within three months of the act complained of, the applicant could not rely upon events taking place before September 1990. Determination of the merits was considered to require detailed evidence and the matter was reserved for a further hearing.\n\nOn 24 June 1992, the Council made a request for further and better particulars of the originating application. The applicant replied on 24 November 1992.\n\nWhile in the ordinary course of events the hearing on the merits would have been listed for hearing in the first half of 1993, the Council applied to the Employment Tribunal for the merits hearing to be postponed, on the grounds that it would be preferable to await the outcome of the applicant's internal appeal. The matter was adjourned, the applicant making no objection to this adjournment.\n\nThe applicant's internal appeal was heard by the Council on 28 April and 4 May 1993. By letter dated 13 May 1993, she was informed that her appeal had been rejected. However, with regard to the applicant's transfer request, the Council committee was concerned at the lack of evidence that any serious consideration was given to this matter and expressed the view that steps should be taken to find the applicant alternative work and to expedite her transfer. Pursuant to this decision, instructions were given to investigate options for a transfer. An offer of transfer was made to the applicant on 8 February 1994.\n\nFollowing the determination of the internal appeal, the Tribunal resumed consideration of the applicant's case, listing the case for a merits hearing on 11-13 May 1994. The case lasted longer than anticipated by the parties and it was adjourned and re-listed. The Council had indicated to the Tribunal on 13 May that it would be possible to reach a negotiated settlement. In the event a settlement was not reached and the Tribunal re-convened on 7 November 1994 for a further four days.\n\nOn 20 December 1994, the Tribunal issued its decision, finding that there had been discrimination by her employer in a number of procedural aspects.\n\nThe proceedings were adjourned for the parties to reach agreement as to the damages payable. The Council had already met with the applicant's trade union representatives on 6 December 1994. Negotiations culminated in a meeting of 24 March 1995, in which the Council's legal representatives agreed a settlement figure with the applicant subject to the approval of the elected members of the Council. On 3 April 1995, the Council informed the applicant that their members had rejected their officers' recommendations and that no settlement was possible on the terms discussed. The applicant broke off the negotiations entirely the next day.\n\nThe Tribunal proposed listing the case in June 1995 but as these dates were not convenient for the Council and it appears that the applicant was not available in June 1995 the date was fixed for 11 September 1995. After a remedies hearing on that date, the Tribunal made the applicant an award of 24,952.51 pounds sterling (GBP), which decision issued on 9 October 1995.\n\nThe Council appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal (“EAT”). Its notice of appeal had been lodged on 27 January 1995, as it was required to be lodged within 42 days of the merits decision.\n\nOn 3 October 1995, an ex parte preliminary hearing was held by the EAT to determine whether the appeal had reasonable prospects of success. It ordered that the appeal should proceed to a full hearing and required the Employment Tribunal's notes of evidence to be disclosed. These consisted of some 50 pages. After their transcription, the EAT sent out a listing notice on 11 July 1996, giving a hearing date of 17 September 1996.\n\nAfter the hearing, the EAT delivered judgment on 28 October 1996. It quashed the findings of discrimination.\n\nOn 12 December 1996, the applicant filed an application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Permission was granted by the Court of Appeal on 3 February 1997. The applicant lodged her notice of appeal on 11 February 1997. The bundles of documents were filed on 21 May 1997.\n\nAfter a hearing, on 16 February 1998 at which the applicant was represented, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeal.\n\nThe Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords on 19 March 1998.\n\nOn 27 March 1998, the applicant sought leave to appeal to the House of Lords. In her petition, she requested exemption under House of Lords Standing Order XIII from the lodgement fee as she was no longer in receipt of legal aid. In July 1998, the Appeal Committee of the House of Lords decided to waive the fee. The petition was then formally lodged in July 1998. The applicant supplied the transcripts necessary for the application on 30 November 1998. The House of Lords refused leave on 26 April 1999.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Olubukunola Obasa - The applicant, UK national born in 1961, social worker who filed discrimination complaint", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Olubukunola Obasa", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "63-64", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Wellingborough / England / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Social worker", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "London Borough of Islington Council", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Social worker", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr I.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-cc965", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 55863/11) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr David Thomas (“the applicant”), on 28 August 2011.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Addis, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention following the expiry of his tariff was unlawful in light of the failure of the authorities to put in place the necessary resources to enable him to demonstrate to the Parole Board that his risk had reduced, and that his Parole Board Review was a meaningless exercise.\n\nOn 2 September 2013 the complaint under Article 5 § 1 was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1968 and is currently detained in HMP North Sea Camp.\n\nOn 8 January 2008 he was convicted of attempted kidnapping. He received an indeterminate sentence for public protection (“IPP sentence”). A minimum term (“tariff”) of one year and nineteen days was fixed.\n\nIn July 2008 it was identified that the applicant was required to complete the Controlling Anger and Learning to Manage it (“CALM”) course to reduce his risk.\n\nOn 12 December 2008 he was transferred to HMP Stocken in order to participate in the CALM course.\n\nThe applicant’s tariff expired on 26 January 2009.\n\nIn March 2009 he commenced the CALM course. He completed it on 28 May 2009.\n\nOn an unknown date he completed the Alcohol Awareness and assertiveness and decision-making courses.\n\nOn 17 February 2010 an oral hearing took place before the Parole Board to review the applicant’s detention. On 26 February 2010 the Parole Board notified him that it had decided not to order his transfer to open conditions or release. It concluded that his level of risk remained incompatible with his safe management in open conditions.\n\nBy letter dated 21 June 2010 the National Offender Management Service informed the applicant that the Secretary of State agreed with the Parole Board recommendation. His review period was set at eighteen months. The review was therefore scheduled to commence in February 2011 with an oral hearing by the Parole Board in August 2011.\n\nIn September 2010 a sentence plan review took place and identified a further course, the Sex Offenders Treatment Programme (“SOTP”), for completion by the applicant. He had failed to admit before September 2010 that there was potentially a sexual element to his offence. Prior to commencement of the SOTP, a Structured Assessment of Risk and Need (“SARN”) was to be conducted.\n\nIn October 2010 the applicant complained to the prison requesting information on when the SARN would take place. On 17 November 2010 he was informed that he would have to be transferred to another prison establishment for assessment because of resource issues.\n\nOn 17 December 2010 he was moved to HMP Acklington for assessment.\n\nOn 20 January 2011 his solicitors sent a letter before claim to the governor of HMP Acklington and the Secretary of State indicating that judicial review proceedings were being considered in respect of the delay in arranging the assessment for the SOTP.\n\nOn 25 January 2011 the applicant’s offender supervisor contacted a forensic psychologist in training in order to discuss the applicant’s case. They agreed that an initial SOTP assessment should be completed.\n\nBy letter dated 8 February 2011 the Ministry of Justice informed the applicant that the assessment of his suitability for the SOTP would be completed by the end of February 2011. He would then be placed on a waiting list for the appropriate course.\n\nThe SOTP assessment was completed on 6 April 2011 and concluded that the applicant was motivated to engage in sex offender treatment.\n\nOn 7 April 2011 the forensic psychologist in training sought clinical guidance on the applicant’s case from the Operational Services Intervention Group (OSIG”). The OSIG decided that a Risk Matrix 2000 (“RM2000”) was required as well as a Treatment Needs Analysis (“TNA”) to assess the level of dynamic risk posed by the applicant.\n\nOn 23 June 2011 a forensic psychologist in training interviewed the applicant and told him that he had been referred for a TNA and RM2000. The applicant was informed that his case would be progressed over the next three months.\n\nOn 30 July 2011 the Parole Board reviewed the applicant’s case on the papers. By letter dated 18 August 2011 it informed him that it had not directed his release or recommended his transfer to open conditions. It explained: “The panel is satisfied that until you have undertaken the offending behaviour work that will be identified by the forthcoming assessments and ... a full assessment has been completed of your response to treatment it will be difficult to conclude that you have addressed the core factors that caused you to offend.”\n\nOn 31 August 2011 the TNA was completed.\n\nBy letter dated 28 September 2011 the National Offender Management Service informed the applicant that the Secretary of State agreed with the Parole Board recommendation. She considered that risk factors, namely sexual offending, thinking skills and behaviour and alcohol misuse, were outstanding. The letter clarified that the Secretary of State could not guarantee to place the applicant on the courses identified as there were limits on the availability of resources.\n\nThe applicant’s next review was set to commence in August 2012 and be completed by April 2013. The review period was made up of, inter alia, appropriate assessments, completion of sexual offender behaviour work, participation in the post-course review and the preparation of the SARN report.\n\nAt some point he was transferred to HMP Northumberland.\n\nOn 9 November 2011 he was told by prison staff that he was on a list of prisoners being considered for the next SOTP.\n\nOn 24 November 2011 the TNA and Treatment Pathway reports were completed. The applicant was deemed suitable for the SOTP. The reports were disclosed to him on 2 December 2011.\n\nOn 22 December 2011 his solicitors wrote to the governor of HMP Northumberland requesting that immediate steps be taken to place the applicant on the next SOTP. They expressed the view that there had been no progress since the April 2011 assessment.\n\nOn 3 May 2012 the applicant commenced the SOTP. He completed the course in November 2012.\n\nA new target date of June 2013 was set to assess whether an oral Parole Board hearing ought to be held in his case. The outcome of the review is not known\n\nA SARN report was produced on 3 April 2013.\n\nOn 4 October 2013 the Secretary of State accepted the applicant’s request for an exceptional transfer to open conditions. He was transferred on 5 November 2013.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr David Thomas - British national, born in 1968, the applicant who was convicted of attempted kidnapping in 2008 and received an indeterminate sentence for public protection", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "David Thomas", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "56-57", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "HMP North Sea Camp / Boston / lincolnshire / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 4}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "HMP North Sea Camp", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms M.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-9a967", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 1092/04) against the French Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a French national, Mr Jean-Claude Gacon (“the applicant”), on 23 December 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr X. Vuitton, of the Conseil d’Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. The French Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Belliard, Director of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the additional time granted to the Principal Public Prosecutor for appealing against a judgment of the Criminal Court amounted to a breach of the principle of equality of arms as enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 16 October 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d’Or.\n\nOn 30 May 1995 the Lyons Central Health Insurance Office (caisse primaire centrale d’assurance maladie) filed a criminal complaint stating that an investigation it had carried out in 1993 had revealed that the price charged for prosthetic knee joints by the Clinique du Parc, of which the applicant was the manager, appeared abnormally high, especially in relation to the price charged in the public sector. It added that the prostheses were directly delivered to the operating theatre at the Clinique du Parc but were billed by a company named Clinique Service, also managed by the applicant, with a systematic increase of 15% for the prostheses and 18.5% for the ancillary equipment, the increased price alone being charged to the Health Insurance Office. The Health Insurance Office therefore had doubts about the Clinique Service company, suspecting that its sole activity consisted in overbilling in this way.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, complaints about similar acts were filed by various other health insurance funds or payment agencies.\n\nThe preliminary investigation found, among other things, that the Clinique Service company had been established in particular to alleviate cash-flow problems resulting from the delay in reimbursement of health care under the third-party payment system. Under this system, in order to be fully reimbursed by the social security scheme for the health care provided, Clinique du Parc had to wait for the invoice from the prosthesis supplier, which meant a delay of several days, if not weeks.\n\nIt also transpired that Clinique Service used the same premises and staff as the Clinique du Parc, that its sole customer was the Clinique du Parc and that its manager, the applicant, was also the manager of the Clinique du Parc together with his brother.\n\nIn an order of 28 August 2000 the applicant and his brother were committed to stand trial in the Lyons Criminal Court, being charged in particular with having deceived the social security scheme and the relevant health insurance offices through fraudulent practices including the operation of a bogus company in order to secure reimbursement.\n\nThe applicant submitted, as part of his defence, that the offence of professional collusion (compérage) was covered by an automatic amnesty and that a prosecution for the same actions characterised as fraud could not succeed, since only the special provisions concerning the characterisation of professional collusion were applicable.\n\nIn a judgment of 30 March 2001 the Lyons Criminal Court held that the prosecution had lapsed as the offence of professional collusion was covered by an automatic amnesty, and that it lacked jurisdiction to examine the claims of the civil parties (the health insurance offices that had lodged the criminal complaint against the applicant) whose interests had been harmed as a result of the acts covered by the automatic amnesty. It further held that the offence of fraud was not made out. The applicant was accordingly acquitted.\n\nWithin the ten-day time-limit laid down in Article 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the civil parties appealed against the judgment of 30 March 2001.\n\nAlthough the public prosecutor at the Criminal Court had declined to appeal within the ten-day time-limit laid down in Article 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Principal Public Prosecutor lodged an appeal against the judgment on 20 April 2001, availing himself of the two-month time-limit granted to him for that purpose by Article 505 of the same Code.\n\nThe applicant submitted, in particular, that the Principal Public Prosecutor’s appeal was inadmissible on the grounds that the time-limit reserved for him was incompatible with the guarantees of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, in particular the principle of equality of arms.\n\nIn a judgment of 13 March 2002 the Lyons Court of Appeal dismissed that argument on the following grounds: “... The provisions of Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by which the time granted to the Principal Public Prosecutor for exercising his right of appeal under Article 497 of the same Code is set at two months, are not incompatible with the principle of a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in so far as the Code secures the right of appeal to defendants, who are given sufficient time in which to make meaningful use of it. The balance between the rights of each party is not upset by the two-month time-limit accorded to the Principal Public Prosecutor, which is justified by the latter’s statutory duty to ensure that the criminal law is applied throughout the area of the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction. ...”\n\nThe Lyons Court of Appeal also upheld the judgment appealed against in so far as it had declared that the prosecution of the offence of professional conspiracy had lapsed by virtue of an amnesty, but overturned it by finding the applicant guilty of the offence of fraud. The applicant was accordingly sentenced to a suspended term of two years’ imprisonment, ordered to pay a fine of 120,000 euros (EUR) and stripped of his civic, civil and family rights for five years. He was also ordered, jointly and severally with his brother, to pay the sum of EUR 442,573.13 in compensation for all the damage found to have been sustained by the civil parties, and EUR 6,800 in respect of the costs incurred by the civil parties.\n\nThe applicant appealed on points of law, arguing in particular that the time available to the Principal Public Prosecutor for lodging an appeal under Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In a judgment of 25 June 2003 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal, holding in particular: “... Article 505 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which sets a two-month time-limit for an appeal by the Principal Public Prosecutor, is not in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in so far as the defendant also has a right of appeal and sufficient time in which to make meaningful use of it. ...”", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Jean-Claude Gacon - French national born in 1940, lives in Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or, manager of Clinique du Parc and Clinique Service, the applicant in this case", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Jean-Claude Gacon", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "84-85", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or / France", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "France", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Manager", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Clinique du Parc", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Manager", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr X.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-69d35", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36689/02) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Lasse Lilja (“the applicant”), on 20 September 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms E.-L. Kiiski, a lawyer practising in Sundbyberg. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr M. Falk, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 6 September 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Norsborg.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings\n\nOn 21 October 1996 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of aggravated tax fraud and an aggravated bookkeeping offence in relation to the declaration of value-added tax and employers’ contributions for the period July 1994 – September 1996 by Latem AB, a building company wholly owned by him. He was detained by a decision of the District Court (tingsrätten) of Stockholm on 23 October 1996 and released from detention on 3 December 1996.\n\nThe applicant was interrogated on several occasions in 1996 and 1997. The preliminary investigation, which concerned 20 companies, was concluded on 25 April 1998. The applicant was notified of the investigation report which covered 7,000 pages. Following submissions by the various suspects, the public prosecutor declared in June 1999 that he expected to bring indictments in the autumn of 1999.\n\nOn 51 occasions thereafter, the public prosecutor requested and the District Court granted extensions of the time-limit for bringing indictments. Eventually, on 28 October 2002 the applicant, together with 16 other suspects, was indicted for aggravated tax fraud and an aggravated bookkeeping offence. The trial commenced on 2 September 2003.\n\nBy a partial judgment of 4 December 2003, the District Court acquitted the applicant of certain charges. By a further judgment of 27 February 2004 the District Court acquitted him of the remaining charges. In the absence of an appeal from the prosecutor, the latter judgment acquired legal force on 19 March 2004.\n\nB. Tax proceedings\n\nOn 22 October 1996 the Tax Authority (skattemyndigheten) of the County of Stockholm initiated an audit of Latem AB’s liability for value-added tax and employers’ contributions concerning the above-mentioned period. On 24 June 1997 the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Stockholm, at the request of the Tax Authority, issued an order that assets belonging to the company could be claimed in security for unpaid value-added tax (but not for any tax surcharges that might be imposed on the company). On 5 December 1997 the Tax Authority completed its audit report. By its communication to the company the same day, the company was informed that the Tax Authority was considering, inter alia, imposing tax surcharges on it.\n\nOn the basis of the findings of the audit, the Tax Authority, by decisions of 18 December 1997 and 26 March and 1 April 1998, revised upwards the taxation bases for calculating the relevant taxes by a total of approximately 3 million Swedish kronor (SEK) (value-added tax) and approximately SEK 14.6 million (employers’ contributions). In addition, Latem AB was considered responsible for employees’ taxes based on a total salary amount of approximately SEK 10.6 million. Moreover, as the information supplied by the company in its tax returns was found to be incorrect, the Tax Authority ordered it to pay tax surcharges (skattetillägg, avgiftstillägg) amounting to 20% of the increased tax liability for value-added tax and employers’ contributions.\n\nThe company appealed to the County Administrative Court. Following an oral hearing on 11 November 1999, the court, by six judgments of 29 November 1999, upheld the Tax Authority’s decisions, save for a minor reduction of the taxation base for employers’ contributions for one year.\n\nOn 4 February 2000 the company appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Stockholm. On 12 February 2003, the appellate court held an oral hearing and, by a judgment of 10 March 2003, it upheld the County Administrative Court’s judgments.\n\nOn 2 October 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court (Regerings-rätten) refused leave to appeal.\n\nC. Other proceedings\n\nOn 15 February 2002 the applicant complained to the Parliamentary Ombudsman (Justitieombudsmannen) about the preliminary investigation against him. The matter was referred to the Director General of the National Economic Crimes Bureau.\n\nIn a decision of 22 November 2002, the Director General criticised the responsible prosecutor for the delays in the preliminary investigation. He found that the prosecutor should have decided whether to bring an indictment at the latest during the autumn of 1999 and thus disagreed with the prosecutor’s opinion that he had to await the outcome of the tax proceedings. The Director General further stated that, whatever reasons there might have been for the delay, it was unacceptable for a suspect to have to wait more than four years after a completed preliminary investigation for a decision whether he would be indicted for offences dating back even further. The Director General was also astonished that the District Court had repeatedly extended the time-limit set for bringing an indictment. Noting that the prosecutor had not given any information on the state of the investigation when requesting extensions and that the court had not asked for such information, he pointed out that the court’s task when examining such requests was to determine whether the seizure of property should remain, to keep itself informed of the state of the investigation and to see to it that the investigation proceeded with appropriate speed.\n\nThe applicant further requested compensation for suffering caused by his detention in 1996.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-fdddb", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator4", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29869/13) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Dariusz Karwowski (“the applicant”), on 19 March 2013.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime on him and its lengthy application amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 July 2014 the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and is currently in detention in Warsaw.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 17 January 2006 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand. He was suspected of the murder of two people and of inciting the murder of another person who had intended to testify against him in a separate set of proceedings.\n\nHe was subsequently convicted several times for various offences. In particular, on 27 February 2013 the Warsaw Regional Court convicted him of murder.\n\nB. Imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime\n\nOn 19 January 2006 the Warsaw Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission (“the commission”) classified the applicant as a dangerous detainee. The decision stated as follows: “The commission hereby decides that [the applicant] is to be placed in a designated wing or cell in a remand centre in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre. The commission approves the proposals of the directors of the protection and prison wings. The detainee has been informed of his right to appeal against the commission’s decision within seven days to the Warsaw Regional Court, XI Penitentiary Division.” The last sentence of the decision contained information about who was to be informed about the applicant’s placement in a cell for dangerous detainees.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nThe commission reviewed and upheld its decision to classify the applicant as a dangerous detainee on several occasions. In total, there were over thirty decisions to extend the period of imposition of the regime in respect of the applicant. All the decisions were based on the same pattern of wording, which read as follows: “The commission has decided to extend [the applicant’s categorisation as a dangerous detainee] as the reasons for his placement in a cell in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre have not ceased to exist.”\n\nIn particular, a decision of 3 January 2013 to extend the imposition of the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and his highly deficient moral character.\n\nAn appeal by the applicant against the latter decision was the only one he made against the series of decisions to impose and extend the dangerous detainee regime on him.\n\nOn 30 January 2013 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the decision had been lawful.\n\nOn 21 November 2013 the commission lifted the dangerous detainee regime applied to the applicant.\n\nC. Specific aspects of the regime\n\nThe applicant was kept in a cell which was constantly monitored via closed‑circuit television. He was subjected to a body search every time he left or entered the cell, which meant in practice that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Dariusz Karwowski - Polish national applicant, born in 1971, currently in detention in Warsaw, convicted of murder and subjected to \"dangerous detainee\" regime", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Dariusz Karwowski", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "53-54", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Warsaw / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms J.

Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that as a woman she was unable to receive invalidity benefit after the age of 60, whereas a man could receive such benefit until the age of 65. The case raised issues under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 27 April 2004, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nFollowing the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006), the Government, but not the applicant, submitted further observations.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Wrexham.\n\nIn August 2003 the applicant turned 60 years of age. Prior to that date she was in receipt of long-term incapacity benefit (IB), a benefit payable to people incapable of work who satisfy the eligibility criteria. She had qualified for the rate of 81.85 pounds sterling (GBP) per week. She was also paid GBP 39.95 per week in disability living allowance (DLA) and GBP 15.15 in DLA care. At age 60, which is the date of entitlement to the State pension for women, she ceased to be eligible for IB. In its place she became entitled to draw her state retirement pension which, based upon her contribution record, entitled her to GBP 57.81 per week (about 62% of the maximum rate as she had only contributed for 24 years out of 39). She continued to draw DLA. As a result, the applicant claimed that she was some GBP 24.04 per week worse off as a result of her transition from IB to the State pension.\n\nThe applicant complained to the Department of Work and Pensions concerning the differential treatment but was informed that nothing could be done.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mrs Joyce Barrow - British national, born in 1943, lives in Wrexham, the applicant who challenged the differential treatment in invalidity benefit eligibility based on gender", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Joyce Barrow", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "82", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Wrexham / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr D.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-2c691", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24647/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yücel Doğan (“the applicant”), on 8 June 2004.\n\nThe Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 11 March 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1969 and lives in İzmir.\n\nOn 7 June 1997 the applicant passed an exam for the post of a private security guard and was subsequently employed to work for Etibank, a State-owned company. However, the exam results were subsequently annulled on the basis of a report prepared by inspectors who had found a number of wrongdoings in the conduct of the examination. The applicant's contract of employment was terminated.\n\nOn 27 November 1997 the applicant brought an action before the 7th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court, challenging the annulment of the exam results. He also asked to be reassigned to his post. The Ankara Administrative Court decided on 9 December 1997 that it had no jurisdiction to examine the case and forwarded the case file to the Konya Administrative Court.\n\nOn 5 March 1998 the Konya court decided that it also did not have jurisdiction to examine the case and sent the file to the Supreme Administrative Court which decided, on 15 June 1998, that the Ankara Administrative Court had jurisdiction.\n\nOn 14 April 1999 the 7th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court decided in favour of the applicant and he was reinstated in his previous post. The court found that the annulment of the exam should not have affected the successful candidates who, by having met the necessary criteria, had passed the exam properly. The bank appealed against the decision on 28 June 1999.\n\nOn 15 November 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the decision. The court found that the report drawn up by the inspectors contained sufficient reasons for the annulment of the exam. The Supreme Administrative Court attached weight to the gravity of the wrongdoings pointed out in that report and concluded that the employment of personnel through such an exam would not be fair.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-fbdef", "number_of_subjects": 4, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 19124/02) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Ms Gisela Kirsten (“the applicant”), on 1 May 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K.H. Christoph, a lawyer practising in Berlin. The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialrätin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn 2 May 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Berlin.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1979 she worked as a ballet dancer for the Erich-Weinert-Ensemble (EWE), a national company of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). In 1979 she terminated her career on stage and worked for the company as a set and costume designer.\n\nThe EWE paid the applicant her wages as a costume and set designer and, in addition, a monthly allowance in the amount of 588 GDR marks (hereafter „the allowance“). The allowance was paid by virtue of the regulation of the Minister of Culture (Anordnung über die Gewährung einer berufsbezogenen Zuwendung an Ballettmitglieder in staatlichen Einrichtungen der DDR) of 1 September 1976. Pursuant to this regulation former members of ballets in the GDR were paid an allowance at the end of their career on stage. The allowance accrued after reaching the age of 35 and having worked for at least 15 years as a dancer. It was paid, irrespective of other earnings, by the former employer. Once the former dancer received an old-age or invalidity pension the allowance was regularly paid by the National Insurance of the GDR (Staatliche Versicherung der DDR).\n\nAfter the reunification of the GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) the EWE which formerly belonged to the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee) of the GDR was incorporated into the organisation of the Federal Ministry of Defence of the FRG. The Ministry took over the contracts with the company's staff and continued to pay the applicant her wages and the allowance. The allowance and the retirement pensions were moreover converted and paid in German Marks (DEM).\n\nOn 1 January 1992 the Ministry discontinued all allowance payments to former ballet dancers with reference to Article 9 § 2 in conjunction with Appendix II, Chapter VIII, Section H, paragraph III Nr. 6 of the German Unification Treaty.\n\nIn December 1992 the applicant brought an action with the Berlin Social Court claiming the payment of the allowance.\n\nOn 24 August 1994 the Federal Social Court ruled in a leading judgment that the social courts had no jurisdiction over disputes concerning the allowance. It found that those disputes belonged to the realm of civil – and more specifically – labour law, inter alia because the granting and the amount of the allowance were so closely linked to the contract of employment and in particular to the respective wages.\n\nOn 13 January 1995 the Berlin Social Court referred the applicant's case to the Frankfurt/Oder Labour Court.\n\nOn 15 May 1996 the Frankfurt/Oder Labour Court ordered the Ministry of Defence to pay the applicant DEM 28,224 and the monthly allowance as of January 1996. It pointed out that the wording of the pertinent provision of the German Unification Treaty was ambiguous. The provision could be interpreted as setting 31 December 1991 as the final date to qualify for the allowance or as terminating permanently the allowance payments from that date onwards. However, in view of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations (Vertrauensschutz) the allowance payments could not be permanently discontinued without an explicit and a precise regulation in the German Unification Treaty. Therefore the provision had to be construed as setting 31 December 1991 as the final date to qualify for the allowance.\n\nOn 13 May 1998 the Brandenburg Regional Labour Court quashed the decision of the Frankfurt/Oder Labour Court and rejected the applicant's action. It admitted that the wording of the pertinent provision was ambiguous. Referring to the leading judgment on the allowance of the Federal Labour Court dated 24 March 1998, it construed the provision as terminating the allowance payments as of 31 December 1991. It argued that the allowance had been paid out of public funds and was an atypical benefit granted by the GDR. Therefore it would have been necessary to rule explicitly that the allowance was to be transferred into the united German legal system. The judgement was served on the applicant on 15 October 1998. The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal on points of law.\n\nOn 8 November 1998 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint of approximately fifty pages with the Federal Constitutional Court. She inter alia complained that the length of the proceedings - which were still pending before the Federal Labour Court - violated Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 26 January 1999 the Federal Labour Court rejected the applicant's request for leave to appeal on points of law.\n\nIn March 1999 the applicant submitted another fifty pages of observations to the Federal Constitutional Court.\n\nOn 2 July 2002 the Federal Constitutional Court delivered a leading decision on the ballet dancers' allowance. It referred to its leading judgment of 28 April 1999, pursuant to which the pension rights acquired in the GDR fell within the scope of Article 14 of the German Basic Law protecting the right to property provided that the German Unification Treaty recognised them as legal claims within the united German legal system. The impugned allowance did accordingly not fall within the scope of Article 14 of the German Basic Law as Article 9 of the German Unification Treaty prescribed that it would not be transferred into the social and labour legislation of the FRG. Furthermore, there had never been a legitimate expectation that the allowance would be transferred into the united German legal system, as in the legal system of the GDR, the allowance had already amounted to a preferential treatment.\n\nOn 4 July 2002 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant's constitutional complaint with reference to its leading decision of 2 July 2002. The decision was served on the applicant's lawyer on 3 August 2002.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Gisela Kirsten - The applicant, German national born in 1944, former ballet dancer for Erich-Weinert-Ensemble from 1960-1979, later worked as set and costume designer, lives in Berlin", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Gisela Kirsten", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "80-81", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Berlin / Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr K.H.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nRelying on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention the applicants complained that their detention in police custody lasted eight days without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr F. Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nOn 14 November 2000 the Chamber retained the applicants' complaint under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1).

The charges were brought under Articles 125 and 168 of the Criminal Code.\n\nIn a judgment dated 14 August 1997 the İzmir State Security Court acquitted Ms Melahat Filiz of the charges, holding that there was insufficient evidence to convict her. The court found Mr Nadir Kalkan guilty of the offences under Articles 125 and 168 and sentenced him to capital punishment.\n\nOn 19 September 1997 Mr Kalkan lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-75642", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 37212/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Timothy Walker (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Gask, a lawyer working for Liberty, London. The British Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the obligation imposed on him as a man in employment over age 60 to pay national insurance contributions, which did not apply to a woman in work of over that age, was in violation of Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 16 March 2004, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).\n\nFollowing the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006), the applicant and the Government submitted further observations.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Shipston Stour, Warwickshire.\n\nUnder current United Kingdom law, the state pension age is 65 for men and 60 for women. Until these ages, men and women who work are required to pay national insurance contributions (“NICs”) if their earnings are above a threshold amount, currently 385 pounds sterling (GBP) per month.\n\nThe applicant is over 60 years old and works as an administrator. Since he has not reached the state pension age for men of 65, he is required to pay NICs on his earnings. At the time of introduction of the application, his monthly salary was GBP 2,970 and he paid 10% of his earnings (between the primary threshold of GBP 385 and the upper earnings limit of GBP 2,535) in NICs (Class 1), amounting to GBP 215 per month and GBP 2,580 per annum. From April 2003, NICs increased to 11% of the amount up to the upper earnings limit, plus an additional 1% on all earnings above the limit. The applicant’s NICs increased to GBP 241.34 per month.\n\nThe applicant will be required to pay national insurance contributions from his earnings until he reaches the age of 65.\n\nA woman of 60 years or more who continued to work would not be required to pay any NICs on her earnings.\n\nThe applicant wrote to his Member of Parliament and the Paymaster General complaining about the difference in treatment for men and women. Both replied stating that since liability to pay national insurance contributions is linked to the state pension age, the treatment of men and women would equalise in 2020 when the state pension age will equalise.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Timothy Walker - British national applicant, born in 1942, lives in Shipston Stour, Warwickshire, works as an administrator, required to pay national insurance contributions due to being a man over 60 but under 65", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Timothy Walker", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "82-83", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Shipston Stour / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Administrator", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-97f90", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18176/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Krzysztofa Wieczorek (“the applicant”), on 16 April 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Z. Cichoń, a lawyer practising in Cracow. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that she had been deprived of the right to a fair hearing because her request for legal aid for lodging a cassation appeal had been refused by the appellate court. She further complained that her right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions had been breached as she had been divested of her disability pension which she had been receiving for fifteen years.\n\nOn 14 November 2006 the Court (Fourth Section) decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Cracow.\n\nIn a letter of 18 September 2000 to the Social Insurance Authority (Zaklad Ubezpieczeń Spolecznych) in Cracow, the applicant's husband submitted that in his view the applicant, who had been receiving a disability pension since 1985, was in fact healthy and should no longer be receiving a pension. He suggested that she be re-examined by competent doctors. Apparently divorce proceedings involving the parties were pending at that time.\n\nOn 10 October 2000 the Social Insurance Authority, referring to the applicant's medical records, instituted proceedings in order to reassess the applicant's condition with a view to establishing whether she complied with the conditions governing entitlement to a disability pension.\n\nIn reply to a query from the applicant about the legal basis on which these proceedings were instituted, on 28 November 2000 the Social Insurance Authority informed her that the proceedings had been instituted under the provisions governing the internal supervision of physicians working for the Authority.\n\nEventually, on 4 December 2000 the Social Insurance Authority gave a decision by which the applicant's right to receive a disability pension was extinguished as she was no longer unfit to work.\n\nOn 12 January 2001 the applicant appealed, submitting that the Social Insurance Authority had failed to assess properly the medical evidence concerning her condition. She also submitted that her condition had been reassessed in 1994, 1995 and 1997. On each of these occasions decisions had been given confirming that she was permanently unfit to work.\n\nIn her pleadings submitted on 18 May and 3 December 2001 the applicant submitted that there was no legal basis for conducting medical examinations in order to reassess her condition. She referred to the 1983 Ordinance, which prohibited reassessment of the medical condition of persons who had been receiving a disability pension for longer than ten years (see paragraph 25 below). The Ordinance provided that no medical examination could be conducted in respect of such persons with a view to a reassessment of their condition. She further invoked the case-law of the Supreme Court which, in the applicant's submission, supported the conclusion that no medical reassessment of a condition which had served as the basis for granting a disability pension could be ordered once ten years had elapsed from the date on which the decision awarding the entitlement to a pension became final (II URN 8/94, see paragraph 28 below).\n\nThe Cracow Regional Court, by a judgment of 24 September 2002, partly amended the decision of the Social Insurance Authority by granting the applicant the disability pension for a fixed period, namely from 1 January 2001 until 1 January 2003.\n\nThe applicant appealed, claiming that in view of her condition she was entitled to a permanent disability pension. She complained about the assessment of the medical evidence by the first-instance court. In her additional pleadings submitted to the Court of Appeal on 6 September 2004, she reiterated her arguments about the lack of legal basis for the reassessment of her condition and concluded that the first-instance judgment was therefore in breach of substantive law.\n\nOn 8 September 2004 the Cracow Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The court examined the complaint concerning the allegedly incorrect assessment of the evidence and concluded that the first-instance court had been thorough in the assessment it had carried out. It also noted that during the appellate proceedings and in view of doubts the appellate court had harboured as to the applicant's condition, it had ordered that, in addition to the evidence available in the applicant's medical records, a medical opinion should be obtained from the local centre for occupational medicine and further examinations should be carried out by specialists in cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology and gynaecology. The applicant had refused to undergo these examinations.\n\nThe court further observed that the first-instance judgment had maintained the applicant's pension for the period from 1 January 2001 until 1 January 2003. When that period expired, the applicant had failed to submit to the Social Insurance Authority a request to have her entitlement to the pension prolonged.\n\nIn response to the applicant's argument based on the 1983 Ordinance and the prohibition it imposed on the medical re-examination of persons in receipt of a disability pension for longer than ten years, the court observed: “It should be borne in mind that the proceedings concerning the applicant's case had been instituted [by the Social Insurance Authority] under the legal provisions governing the internal supervision by the principal physician of doctors working for that Authority and assessing the medical condition of persons seeking a disability pension (see Article 11 of the 1997 Ordinance of the Minister of Labour and Social Policy). Accordingly, it was of no legal relevance to the applicant's case that she had been declared permanently unfit to work in 1985. Neither was the length of time for which she had been receiving her pension of any significance for the present case.”\n\nOn 13 October 2004 the Cracow Court of Appeal refused to grant the applicant legal aid to lodge a cassation appeal. The written grounds for the refusal read as follows: “Under Article 117 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure a party to proceedings who has been exempted, fully or in part, from the obligation to pay court fees can request that a legal-aid lawyer be assigned to represent him or her in the case. The court shall allow such a request if it decides that the participation of a lawyer in the case is necessary. A legal-aid lawyer shall be so assigned where the party is unable to argue the case competently or the case is complex as to the facts or law. The crucial issue in the present case was the assessment of the [applicant's] condition and, consequently, it cannot be regarded as so complex as to warrant legal assistance. The court therefore considers that legal assistance would be unnecessary and, accordingly, dismisses the applicant's request. The mere fact that a party cannot afford to pay legal fees does not justify the granting of legal assistance; this also applies to cases where legal representation is mandatory for the preparation of the cassation appeal.”", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Krzysztofa Wieczorek - Polish national applicant, born in 1952, lives in Cracow, received disability pension since 1985", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Krzysztofa Wieczorek", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "72-73", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Cracow / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Divorced", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr Z.

Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention pending trial\n\nThe applicant was arrested by the police on 12 September 2001 on a charge of murder and by a decision of the Bytów District Court of 14 September 2001 he was detained on remand.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s pre-trial detention was prolonged on several occasions by the Słupsk Regional Court (decisions of 6 December 2001, 2 January 2002, 22 March 2002, 20 December 2002, 18 March 2003 and 16 June 2003).\n\nThe applicant on several occasions unsuccessfully applied to be released and to have the preventive measure imposed on him changed into a more lenient one.\n\nThe courts justified their decisions prolonging the applicant’s detention on remand and their refusals to release him by the existence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence concerned and by the severity of the anticipated sentence.\n\nOn 22 March 2002 the Słupsk Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment. On 5 September 2002 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the lower court.\n\nOn 16 September 2003 the Słupsk Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. On 10 February 2004 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the lower court.\n\nOn 7 February 2005 the Słupsk Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. On 23 June 2005 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to six years’ imprisonment. A cassation appeal against the second-instance judgment was available.\n\nOn 23 June 2005 the applicant was released because of his health which had prevented him from serving a term of imprisonment. The applicant submitted that from August 2005 he had been examined several times by psychiatrists and that he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for short periods on five occasions. He had been diagnosed with nervous depression.\n\n2. Censorship of the applicant’s correspondence\n\nOn 5 March 2003 the Court received a letter from the applicant dated 9 February 2003. The envelope bore the following stamps: “the Słupsk Regional Court (...)” and “Censored on 18 February” (Ocenzurowano dnia 18.02) and an illegible signature.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Antoni Janus -

Einsle, a lawyer practising in Bregenz. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The German Government did not make use of their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention).\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that her right to remain silent and not to incriminate herself had been breached in criminal proceedings against her.\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 18 March 2004 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Laupheim (Germany).\n\nOn 17 January 1997 at 18.45 p.m. the car of which the applicant is the registered owner was caught in Austria by a radar-trap exceeding the speed limit by 26 km/h.\n\nOn 12 March 1997 the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) ordered the applicant pursuant to section 103 § 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrzeuggesetz) to disclose within two weeks the full name and address of the person who had been driving her car at the material time on 17 January 1997.\n\nOn 24 March 1997 the applicant replied that Mr J.S. [first and family name in full], living in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina had been the driver.\n\nOn 17 April 1997 the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority issued a provisional penal order (Strafverfügung) in which it sentenced the applicant under sections 103 § 2 and 134 § 1 of the Motor Vehicles Act to pay a fine of 1,500 Austrian schillings (ATS) with two days' imprisonment in default.\n\nThe applicant filed an objection against this decision.\n\nOn 22 September 1997 the District Administrative Authority dismissed the applicant's objection and issued a penal order (Straferkenntnis) confirming its previous decision. It found that the applicant had failed to give complete information as requested in the order of 12 March.\n\nThe applicant appealed on 1 October 1997 submitting in particular that she had replied to the District Administrative Authority's order, but had been unable to find out the exact address of Mr J.S. Further, she claimed that the obligation under section 103 § 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act to disclose the driver of her car violated the presumption of innocence and her right not to incriminate herself. Finally, she pointed out that she was a German national and that German law did not contain a comparable obligation of the registered car owner to disclose who had been driving the car at a specified time.\n\nOn 26 November 1997 the Vorarlberg Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat) dismissed the applicant's appeal. As to the applicant's complaint that the obligation under section 103 § 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act violated the right not to incriminate oneself and the presumption of innocence, it noted that the relevant sentence of that provision had constitutional rank.\n\nOn 30 December 1997 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof).

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-016fe", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41956/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yavuz Aksaç (“the applicant”), on 6 January 1998.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr H. Erdoğan and Mr L. Kanat, lawyers practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that he had been denied a fair hearing on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He further complained under Article 6 § 3 (b) that the written opinion of the chief public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments. He finally contended that he had been convicted merely on account of his association with a left-wing magazine, in violation of his rights under Articles 9 and 10.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 15 January 2004 the Court declared the application partly admissible. It retained the applicant’s complaints concerning his right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal and his right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn 24 May 2004 the case was assigned to the Third Section of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Ankara.\n\nOn 23 March 1995 the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody by police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate. He was accused of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front).\n\nOn 6 April 1995 the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court filed an indictment with the latter charging the applicant, under Articles 168 § 2 and 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, with membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 10 April 1996 the Ankara State Security Court found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C, and sentenced him to three years and nine months’ imprisonment and debarred him from public service for three years.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 11 June 1997 the chief public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion (tebliğname) on the merits of the appeal to the Court of Cassation. The chief public prosecutor proposed that the first instance court’s judgment be upheld. The written opinion of the chief public prosecutor was read out during the hearing before the Court of Cassation.\n\nOn 10 July 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal upholding the Ankara State Security Court’s judgment.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Yavuz Aksaç - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1971, lives in Ankara, convicted of aiding and abetting illegal organization DHKP-C and sentenced to three years and nine months' imprisonment", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Yavuz Aksaç", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "53-54", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Ankara / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "DHKP-C", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr H.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-1541d", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 17249/12) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Andrzej Szafrański (“the applicant”), on 1 March 2012.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr M. Jarzyński, a lawyer practising in Poznań. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that as a result of poor sanitary conditions and, especially, the insufficient separation of sanitary facilities from the rest of the cell, his rights under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention had been breached.\n\nOn 17 November 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and is currently in detention in Wronki.\n\nThe applicant has been serving a prison sentence in Wronki Prison since 31 March 2010.\n\nOn 19 September 2010 he brought a civil compensation claim before the Szamotuły District Court. He claimed that the conditions of detention in many of his cells in Wronki Prison were so bad as to amount to a breach of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. He referred to the fact that the cells were not properly heated in the autumn and winter and had no proper ventilation in the summer, meaning that the prisoners suffered from intense levels of heat. The windows were old and the frames leaked. He further submitted that the toilet facilities were only separated from the cells by a low fibreboard partition, which made even a minimum level of privacy impossible for him.\n\nOn 21 June 2011 the Szamotuły District Court refused a request by the applicant to gather evidence by producing photographs and carrying out an on-the-spot inspection of the cells concerned. It closed the hearing and gave judgment, dismissing the applicant’s claim in its entirety. The court established, referring to evidence submitted by the State Treasury, acting as the legal representative for Wronki Prison, that prisoners had access to sports, cultural and educational activities and medical care. They were provided with personal hygiene items and had appropriate food. Those factors, seen as a whole, alleviated the harm which was an inherent part and consequence of serving prison sentences. The court further found that the toilet facilities in the applicant’s cells were indeed separated off by fibreboard partitions. This did not provide full privacy, but was sufficient to ensure that the prisoners were out of sight of others when they used the toilet. There was a WC and a washbasin in each toilet facility. As regards the applicant’s allegations of inadequate ventilation and insufficient heating in the cells, the court found that the cells were well lit and properly ventilated; the windows had been repaired and the heaters had been changed and worked properly. As regards the alleged lack of light, the court found that the applicant had been granted special permission to use an additional reading lamp. The court was of the view that the State Treasury had not acted unlawfully and that there had been no intention to act in bad faith or to cause harm or damage to the applicant. In the absence of unlawfulness no breach of personal rights could be found. In any event, the conditions in Wronki Prison were not so harsh as to amount to a breach of personal rights.\n\nThe applicant appealed, arguing that the court had failed to establish the facts of the case correctly, in the main because it had refused to gather evidence in the form of photographs, film or an inspection of the cells. The judgment had therefore been based on insufficient factual findings. Furthermore, in so far as the court had referred to the general conditions in which the applicant served his sentence (quality of the food, medical care, access to cultural and sports activities), those factors had not constituted the basis of his claim. He had complained neither about poor food quality nor about insufficient access to cultural and sports activities. The grounds of his claim had fundamentally related to the sanitary conditions in the cells and, in particular, a lack of privacy when using the toilet. This lack of privacy had been explicitly confirmed by the first-instance court. He reiterated that the lack of a proper divide between the toilets and the cell amounted to a breach of his personal rights and dignity. He further indicated that some of the cells at the prison had toilet facilities that were properly separated from the rest of the cell by normal walls and a door.\n\nBy a judgment of 6 December 2011 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, fully accepting the findings of fact made by the first‑instance court and that court’s legal assessment of those facts. In particular, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the nuisance caused by the manner in which cells were fitted with toilet facilities, namely by way of fibreboard partitions, did not exceed the normal difficulties and harm which were inherent in serving a prison sentence.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Andrzej Szafrański - Polish national applicant, born in 1963, currently in detention in Wronki Prison since 31 March 2010, brought civil compensation claim regarding poor sanitary conditions", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Andrzej Szafrański", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "61-62", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Wronki / Poland", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Wronki Prison", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Prisoner", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr M.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-1303e", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 71841/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged on 14 May 1998 with the European Commission of Human Rights under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Cahit Yetkinsekerci (“the applicant”).\n\nThe British Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 11 December 2003 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Gaziantep.\n\nOn 3 September 1997, 79 packages of powder (subsequently found to be starch) were found in the belly tank of the apparently unladen lorry which the applicant had just brought into the United Kingdom. The applicant was arrested, and on 4 September 1997 he was charged with knowingly being involved in the attempted import of a controlled drug (diamorphine). He was convicted on 25 March 1998 and sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment. His application for leave to appeal arrived at the Criminal Appeals Office on 23 April 1998, and leave to appeal and legal aid were granted on 22 March 1999.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 6 March 2001. As to sentence it found as follows: “76. ... The points ... are, first, that no diamorphine was imported and that seems to us to be the most important point, namely that this was an offence of attempt and not of actual importation.\n\nSecond, that the appellant appears to have occupied a lowly position in what was undoubtedly an extensive chain, stretching from source abroad into this country.\n\nThird, it is said that there was no evidence that he knew of the quantity involved. However, in that respect, in a massive importation of this kind, it is not usual to investigate how far an appellant was privy to the actual amount involved, bearing in mind that it would obviously have been an extremely substantial importation.\n\nFourth, the point is made that he is isolated from his country of origin, serving a sentence in England.\n\nFifth, that his age is 49, he is of previous good character and family responsibilities also militate for mercy.\n\nWe attach some slight importance to the fourth element. So far as the fifth is concerned it is not one in which of a case of this kind we regard appropriate and to take into consideration [sic].\n\nFinally, counsel has advanced upon us the argument that this appeal has taken, as it undoubtedly has taken, an unconscionably long time to come on, for reasons which are no fault of the appellant or his advisers, but appear to have related to administrative difficulties within this court. He makes reference in that respect to Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights. However, it is not necessary to invoke that Article for the court to take into account, if it considers it appropriate, a delay of that kind.\n\nWe consider that, absent any reason for reduction of an unusual kind, had this importation been an importation of diamorphine, as the appellant no doubt believed it to be, a sentence of 18 years could have been expected. It does appear that, on the basis that it was simply an attempt, the judge reduced the level of sentence to the order of 14 years, bearing in mind the appellant’s apparent position in the chain.\n\nIn our view, a somewhat greater allowance could well have been made, allowing this with the fact that the defendant has spent a time of some anxiety, no doubt, waiting for longer than he should, in order to see whether his sentence would be reduced, we consider that it is appropriate to reduce the sentence of 14 years imposed to one of 12 years’ imprisonment. The appeal upon the sentence will be successful to that extent.”\n\nThe applicant was released after having served approximately one half of the 12 year sentence, and deported to Turkey.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Cahit Yetkinsekerci - Turkish national applicant, born in 1951, lives in Gaziantep, convicted of attempted drug importation and sentenced to imprisonment", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Cahit Yetkinsekerci", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "73-74", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Gaziantep / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Truck driver", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 4}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms E.

Ertürk, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 3 September 2002 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a set of enforcement proceedings against his debtors in order to enforce the payment of six bonds issued by his debtors between 1980 and 1981. The enforcement proceedings lasted for almost ten years. In 1993 the applicant was paid a sum of 54,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL), interest included.\n\nOn 25 January 1994 the applicant brought an action before the Istanbul Commercial Court against his debtors and requested an additional compensation under Article 105 of the Code of Obligations, for the damage he sustained as a result of the delay in payment. He alleged that the payment was made with ten years of delay and that his loss resulting from the increase in inflation during this period exceeded the interest awarded to him for late payment.\n\nOn 17 April 1995 an expert report was submitted to the court. The expert report stated that the applicant should not be awarded additional compensation on the ground that he was unable to substantiate the damages he sustained against inflation.\n\nOn 5 October 1995 the Istanbul Commercial Court dismissed the applicant’s request for the reasons stated in the expert’s report. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 24 December 1996 the Court of Cassation quashed the first- instance court’s decision on the ground that the applicant had sustained damages due to the delay in payment and that he should be awarded compensation. The case was remitted to the first instance court.\n\nOn 29 September 1997 the first-instance court adhered to its first decision. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 3 November 1999 the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court’s decision.

It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Van.\n\nIn 2008, during his military service, the applicant was disbanded from the army as he was diagnosed with a psychotic illness by the Van Military Hospital.\n\nSubsequently, on 7 October 2008 he initiated compensation proceedings, claiming that he had become ill during his military service as a result of the degrading treatment he had been subjected to in the army. He claimed that he had been healthy before and that the Ministry of Defence had failed to provide medical treatment for his condition. The applicant requested a total of 150,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 80,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, submitting the medical records from the Van Military Hospital in support of his claims. He also requested legal aid for the court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtar) attesting to his poverty.\n\nOn 28 October 2008 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s legal aid request, after having stated that pursuant to the Code on Civil Procedure, a legal aid request must be supported by proof that the case is well-founded and that the plaintiff does not have the means to pay the required court fees. The court concluded that the requirements were not met in the applicant’s case.\n\nOn 31 October 2008 the court informed the applicant that he was to pay a total of TRY 2,384 (approximately EUR 1,300) in court fees within thirty days for the proceedings to be continued.\n\nOn 4 February 2009 the Supreme Military Administrative Court decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Erdal Kıran - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1987, lives in Van, former military service member who was disbanded due to psychotic illness and sought compensation", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Erdal Kıran", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "37-38", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Van / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr S.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-193f8", "number_of_subjects": 2, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 4317/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Andrzej Kaźmierczak (“the applicant”), on 22 December 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 18 October 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Wrocław.\n\nOn 18 April 2002 the Opole District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed several offences of fraud and that he had organised and led a criminal group.\n\nOn 15 July 2002 the court extended the applicant’s detention until 17 September 2002. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and on the risk that he might tamper with evidence.\n\nOn 13 September 2002 the court extended the applicant’s detention until 17 November 2002. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention and found that his remaining in custody was necessary to complete the expert psychiatric examination as to the state of the applicant’s mental health.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on 14 November 2002. The court attached importance to the serious nature of the offences with which he had been charged and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed on him.\n\nOn 11 December 2002, the applicant was indicted on several charges of fraud while acting in an organised criminal group. Subsequently, in March 2003, the case file was transferred to the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court for reasons of procedural economy.\n\nOn 23 April 2003 the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court extended the applicant’s detention for a three-month period, until 23 July 2003. It considered that the severity of the anticipated sentence and the need to secure the proper course of the trial justified the continuation of that measure.\n\nOn 22 July 2003 the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 October 2003. It also observed that the applicant’s continued detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the gravity of the anticipated sentence. In addition, it referred to the complex nature of the case.\n\nOn 13 October 2003 the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 January 2004. The court referred to a strong likelihood that he had committed the serious offences with which he had been charged and stressed that a heavy penalty might be imposed on him. It also observed that no other measures would prevent the applicant from obstructing the proceedings or going into hiding.\n\nThat decision was upheld by the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 7 November 2003. The Regional Court stated in the relevant part of the reasons for its decision that: “The appeals are not well-founded. (...) The District Court correctly pointed out that the fear that the accused would tamper with evidence arises also from the fact – as proved by the collected evidence - that he organised and led the group of offenders. Consequently, there is a strong probability that by using the same methods of pressure on the co-accused he may induce them to tamper with evidence.”\n\nBetween 14 November 2003 and 12 January 2004 the court held four hearings, two of which were adjourned.\n\nOn 21 January 2004 the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 March 2004.\n\nIn the course of the investigation and the court proceedings the applicant made numerous unsuccessful applications for release on bail or under police supervision and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against decisions extending his detention.\n\nOn 18 February 2004 the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court dismissed the applicant’s application for release, holding that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid. The Court also expressed an opinion that his detention could be lifted and replaced by another preventive measure. It fixed bail at 100,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) [approx. 25,500 euros (EUR)], to be paid before 10 March 2004.\n\nOn 22 March 2004 the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 10 April 2004. It also stated that the detention would be lifted if the applicant put up the bail.\n\nOn 25 March 2004 the applicant was released on bail. The court found that releasing the applicant on bail would be sufficient to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, taking into account the fact that it had heard evidence from him.\n\nBetween 9 March 2004 and 20 March 2006 the court held thirty‑three hearings.\n\nIt appears that the criminal proceedings are still pending.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Andrzej Kaźmierczak - Polish national applicant, born in 1955, lives in Wrocław, charged with fraud and organizing/leading a criminal group", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Andrzej Kaźmierczak", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "69-70", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Wrocław / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr J.

Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. On 14 October 1999 the Court decided to join the applications.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.\n\nBy a decision of 21 March 2002 the Court declared the applications partly admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI.

They were subsequently forwarded to the Warsaw District Court, before which criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending at that time, and were read by the court.\n\nOn 29 April 1996 the applicant requested the President of the Warsaw District Court to explain what was the legal basis on which his correspondence with the European Commission of Human Rights had been opened and read.\n\nHe reiterated his complaint on 31 July 1996 in a letter to the President of the Regional Court. In reply, on 15 October 1996 the President of the Regional Court informed him that Article 8 of the Convention did not prohibit censorship of correspondence of persons detained on remand. It was also permitted under Section 33 § 2 of the Rules of Detention on Remand. The correspondence sent to the European Commission of Human Rights fell within the scope of this provision. It was further stated that the text of the Convention did not contain provisions relating to the inviolability of the correspondence to and from the European Commission of Human Rights.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Zbigniew Radaj -

He requested that the applicant be sentenced pursuant to Article 526 of the Criminal Code. The indictment was not served on the applicant. On 9 April 2004 the İzmir Magistrates' Court, without holding a hearing, issued a penal order and found the applicant guilty as charged. The court sentenced the applicant to three months' imprisonment and to a fine of 54,525,000 Turkish Liras (TRL). In the same judgment, the court commuted the sentence of imprisonment to a fine.

Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 17 December 2002 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. It also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1919 and lives in Lubań, Poland.\n\nThe applicant was involved in administrative proceedings concerning the amount of the veteran benefit he had been receiving since 1974. On 12 September 1995 the Supreme Administrative Court gave a judgment in his case. The court, inter alia, ordered the Office for Veterans and Persecuted Persons (Urząd do Spraw Kombatantów i Osób Represjonowanych) to pay the applicant a sum of PLN 10 as reimbursement of the court fees. In May 1997 the applicant received from the Office for Veterans and Persecuted Persons only a half of the awarded sum (PLN 5).\n\nIn April 1997 the applicant lodged with the Lubań District Court (Sąd Rejonowy w Lubaniu) a civil action against the Office for Veterans and Persecuted Persons. He claimed compensation and payment of, inter alia, the remaining sum of PLN 5.\n\nOn 7 May 1997 the Lubań District Court transmitted the case to the Warsaw District Court.\n\nThe Warsaw District Court held one hearing and on 30 November 1998 it gave a default judgment (wyrok zaoczny) against the defendant ordering it to pay PLN 50 in compensation and PLN 30 as a reimbursement of the court fees. The court ordered that the judgment should be immediately enforceable.\n\nOn 30 March 1999 the defendant lodged an objection against this decision.\n\nOn 18 October 1999 the Warsaw District Court suspended the enforcement order in respect of the judgment of 30 November 1998.\n\nThe applicant asked the court to order again that the judgment of 30 November 1998 be immediately enforceable. On 29 October 1999 the Warsaw District Court dismissed his request. The applicant appealed against this decision and was ordered to pay the court-fees. On 22 August 2000 his appeal was rejected due to the applicant's failure to pay the court fees. In the appeal procedure against this decision he was also ordered to pay the court‑fees. Finally, the applicant paid the court-fees and on 16 December 2002 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) examined his appeal against the decision of 29 October 1999 and dismissed it.\n\nOn 23 October 1999 the Warsaw District Court, sitting in camera, decided that the applicant would be heard by the Lubań District Court.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-f8860", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator5", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18403/91) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Mrs Anna Evagorou Christou (“the applicant”), on 31 May 1991.\n\nThe applicant, who was granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A. Demetriades, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had deprived her of her home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 24 August 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b)).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1925 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant lived with her family in Kalogrea, a village in the District of Kyrenia. During the 1974 intervention, the Turkish military troops evicted the applicant and her family from their home and forced them to leave Kyrenia and flee to the south.\n\nThe applicant alleged that until 7 September 1999, when the properties were transferred to her children, she had been the owner of ten plots of land in Kalogrea, two of which had one house each on them. One of these houses had been the applicant’s home. It was an ancestral house built in 1916, comprising huge, spacious rooms, two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. It had two levels and a huge yard. It was built of stone, had marble floors and a titled roof, and wooden doors and windows. The second house was the applicant’s holiday home, built in 1958 and situated in the locality known as Roukania. It had two spacious bedrooms and was very close to the sea (about 50 metres).\n\nIn support to her claim to ownership, the applicant produced affirmations of ownership issued by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus, stating that she was the legal and registered owner of the two houses and of the pieces of lands registered under the plots nos. 260, 268, 45, 119/5, 119/6, 164.9, 121/2/3, 122/2/4, 359/1 and 425. The applicant also produced certificates of registration for eight of the ten properties at issue.\n\nThe applicant claimed that she had been prevented from returning to her home and properties because the Turkish military authorities had continuously occupied and used them.\n\nOn 9 December 1990 the applicant made an attempt to return to her home and property in Kyrenia and in the Kalogrea Village by participating in a convoy of cars of fellow refugees intending to return home. The demonstration organisers had informed the Commander of the United Nations (UN) forces in Cyprus of their intentions.\n\nThe applicant and her fellow refugees stopped at the check point in the “buffer zone“, on the main road linking Nicosia and Famagusta. There, they asked the UN officer on duty to be allowed to return to their homes, property and villages. They requested the same officer to forward their demand to the Turkish military authorities. The officer replied that the latter had refused their request.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mrs Anna Evagorou Christou - Applicant, Cypriot national born in 1925, lives in Nicosia, former owner of properties in Kalogrea village, forced to flee during 1974 Turkish military intervention", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Anna Evagorou Christou", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "99-100", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Nicosia / Cyprus", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Cyprus", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-f851b", "number_of_subjects": 2, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29921/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Cengiz Büker (“the applicant”), on 2 October 1995.\n\nThe applicant was granted leave by the President to represent himself in the proceedings before the Court (Rule 36 § 3 of the Rules of Court). The President refused the applicant’s request for anonymity (Rule 47 § 3). The respondent Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention about the unreasonable length of time taken by his university employer to reinstate him following a decision in his favour by a domestic court.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 21 March 2000 the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nAfter consulting the parties, the Chamber decided that it was not necessary to hold a hearing. Neither the applicant nor the Government submitted observations on the merits in the post-admissibility procedure.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant worked on the basis of a two-year contract, beginning on 9 December 1985, as an assistant Professor in the Faculty of Medicine of the Kayseri Erciyas University. Under Turkish law he had the status of a civil servant.\n\nIn an administrative decision dated 21 December 1987 the Office of the University President concluded that the applicant’s contract would not be renewed on the grounds of his professional incompetence. The applicant maintained that he was not informed of this decision until he went to the bank to draw out his monthly salary.\n\nOn 4 March 1988 the applicant challenged the decision before the Kayseri Administrative Court. In a judgment dated 6 December 1989 (Judgment no. 1) the court ruled in the applicant’s favour finding that the administration failed to substantiate its view that he was not competent for the post. The court annulled the administrative decision. On 29 January 1990 the court’s judgment was served on the Office of the University President, which failed to comply with it within the 60-day period prescribed by domestic law.\n\nThe Office of the University President appealed and the file was sent to the Supreme Administrative Court on 22 May 1990. On 13 June 1990 the 5th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Kayseri Administrative Court. This judgment was served on the Office of the University President on 30 July 1990. The case was subsequently remitted to the Kayseri Administrative Court.\n\nIn a judgment dated 5 July 1991 (Judgment no. 2) the Kayseri Administrative Court adhered to (uyma) the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court and held that the decision of the Office of the University President not to renew the applicant’s contract was lawful.\n\nOn 21 August 1991 the applicant appealed to the 5th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court. The file was referred to the court on 4 October 1991. On 18 March 1992 the 5th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Kayseri Administrative Court of 5 July 1991.\n\nOn 13 October 1992 the applicant subsequently petitioned the 5th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court requesting rectification (karar düzeltme) of its latest judgment. On 21 June 1993 the 5th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court rectified its judgment by quashing the judgment of the Kayseri Administrative Court of 5 July 1991. The case was remitted to the Kayseri Administrative Court.\n\nIn a judgment dated 2 December 1993 (Judgment no. 3) the Kayseri Administrative Court adhered to (uyma) the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of 21 June 1993 and again annulled the 1987 decision of the Office of the University President. On 19 February 1994 this judgment was served on the Office of the University President. The Office of the University President again did not comply with this new judgment within the 60-day period prescribed by domestic law.\n\nOn 23 February 1994 the Office of the University President appealed against the judgment (Judgment no. 3) of the Kayseri Administrative Court. On 27 June 1994 the 8th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment. The judgment restated that the administration had failed to substantiate its view that the applicant was not competent for the post.\n\nThe Office of the University President requested the 8th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court to rectify its judgment (karar düzeltme). On 23 March 1995 the 8th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court rejected this request.\n\nOn 28 March 1995 the applicant sent a notarised letter to the Office of the University President demanding that he be reinstated in his former post and be awarded the salary and other monetary rights owing to him.\n\nOn 7 December 1995 the applicant received a letter from the Office of the University President dated 4 December 1995 notifying him that he had been re-appointed to his former post as of 23 November 1995. On 15 December 1995 the applicant took up his functions.\n\nOn 27 December 1995 the applicant resigned. He requested the Office of the University President to process his voluntary retirement.\n\nIn three separate actions, the applicant sued the Office of the University President before the Kayseri Administrative Court, requesting that he be paid the monthly salaries and related monetary rights for the periods during which he was entitled to assume his duties in accordance with the judgments of the domestic courts upholding his claim to reinstatement.\n\nIn three judgments dated 25 January 1994, 25 January 1995 and 16 January 1996, the Kayseri Administrative Court held, inter alia, that since the Office of the University President had unlawfully failed to comply with its two judgments in favour of the applicant within the 60-day period prescribed by domestic law, it was liable in damages to the applicant having regard to the court’s finding that the decision to terminate his contract was unlawful. It ruled that the applicant was to be paid his monthly salary and related monetary rights for the given period.

Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been unlawfully detained in a regular detention centre pending his transfer to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn 1 September 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1) and to grant priority to the application (Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and is currently detained in Kassel, Germany.\n\nOn 7 December 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of uttering threats and domestic violence. On 8 December 2007 the Żary District Court ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 22 December 2007 he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was discharged from the hospital on 2 January 2008.\n\nOn 9 April 2008 the Żary District Court gave a decision and discontinued the proceedings against the applicant. The court found it established that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. However, he could not have been held criminally responsible as he had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It further referred to the experts' opinion and ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn the same date the court also refused the applicant's motion for release. The court considered that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant might commit another crime.\n\nOn 23 April 2008 the Żary District Court extended the applicant's detention until 22 September 2008. The court referred to the reasons given previously. In addition, it relied on the risk that the applicant might commit yet another offence. It stressed that it was necessary to keep the applicant in detention until his admission to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nThe applicant was transferred between different detention centres. After 28 March 2008 he was detained in the Nowa Sól Detention Centre.\n\nOn 21 May 2008 the Żary District Court was informed that the applicant had appealed against the decision of 9 April 2008. However he had filed his appeal with the Supreme Court instead of with the Regional Court. Therefore, the Supreme Court asked the lower court to examine whether the applicant's motion could be regarded as an appeal against the decision of 9 April 2008.\n\nOn 2 July 2008 the Zielona Góra Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the decision of 9 April 2008. The court held that all the conditions for imposing the preventive measure on the applicant had been met.\n\nOn 7 July 2008 the Żary District Court gave a decision and ordered that the applicant be placed in the Lubiąż Psychiatric Hospital. It was also established that the applicant could be admitted to this facility on 8 August 2008. However, the applicant subsequently appealed against this decision in so far as it related to the choice of hospital and the case file was transferred to the Zielona Góra Regional Court. On 29 August 2008 the Zielona Góra Regional Court upheld the decision of 7 July 2008.\n\nThe applicant was admitted to the hospital on 15 September 2008.\n\nIt appears that he left the hospital on a later unknown date before February 2009.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Grzegorz Jończyk - Polish national born in 1976, the applicant in this case, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, charged with uttering threats and domestic violence", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Grzegorz Jończyk", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "48-49", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Kassel / Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr J.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-90f4b", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39013/04) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the following four Swedish Sami villages (samebyar): Handölsdalen, Mittådalen, Tåssåsen and Ruvhten Sijte (formerly Tännäs) (“the applicants”) on 29 October 2004.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr J. Södergren and Mr C. Crafoord, lawyers practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.-H. Ehrenkrona, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicants alleged, in particular, that they had not had effective access to court and that the length of the national proceedings had been unreasonable.\n\nBy a decision of 17 February 2009, the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant Sami villages are all situated in the municipality of Härjedalen in the county of Jämtland.\n\nThe Sami have, since ancient times, inhabited the northern parts of Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula. Originally living by hunting, fishing and collecting, the Sami activities changed over time to concern mainly reindeer herding. Their historical use of the land has given rise to a special right to real estate, the reindeer herding right (renskötselrätten). Presently regulated in Sweden by the Reindeer Husbandry Act (Rennäringslagen, 1971:437), it comprises the right to use land and water for the Sami's own sustenance and that of his reindeer. The right may only be exercised by the members of a Sami village. Such villages are both geographical grazing areas and economic entities. They do not have any public legal status (see Könkämä and 38 Other Sami Villages v. Sweden, no. 27033/95, Commission decision of 25 November 1996, Decisions and Reports 87, p. 85 in fine). The reindeer herding area comprises approximately one-third of the surface of Sweden and is divided into all-year land and winter grazing land. In certain parts of the country, the borders of the herding area are controversial and have not been statutorily defined, especially as concerns the winter grazing land.\n\nOn 20 September 1990 a large number of private owners of land in the municipality of Härjedalen instituted proceedings against five Sami villages, the four applicants and the Idre Nya Sami village, before the District Court (tingsrätten) of Sveg. On 4 June 1991 more landowners initiated a similar action against the Sami villages. The landowners sought a declaratory judgment (negativ fastställelsetalan) that the Sami villages had no right to reindeer grazing on their land without a valid contract to that effect concluded between the landowner and the village.\n\nOn 26 June 1991 the District Court issued a summons and decided that the two cases were to be examined jointly. At a preparatory meeting on 16 September 1991, the court rejected the villages' request for dismissal of the cases on procedural grounds.\n\nOn 25 November 1991 the Sami villages submitted their response, contesting the landowners' action. The villages claimed that they had the right to winter grazing within their respective areas based on (1) prescription from time immemorial (urminnes hävd), (2) the provisions of the reindeer grazing and reindeer husbandry acts of 1886, 1898, 1928 and 1971, (3) custom, or (4) public international law, more specifically Article 27 of the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights, as compared with Chapter 1, section 2, of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen).\n\nFollowing three extensions of the time-limit fixed by the District Court, the landowners replied to the Sami villages' submissions on 10 April 1992. An additional preparatory meeting was held on 27 August 1992, at which the parties discussed, inter alia, the possibility of reaching a settlement. Furthermore, the villages were ordered to elaborate on their claim based on custom and to specify their means of evidence. They did so on 23 December 1992 following two extensions of the time-limit set. At the same time, they requested that the court inspect some of the properties concerned.\n\nOn 27 May 1993, having been granted several extensions, the landowners submitted a specification of the means of evidence offered. During the following months, the parties exchanged views on questions of evidence and submitted specifications of supplementary evidence. On 9 May 1994 the District Court sent a summary of the respective positions to the parties for comments. A further preparatory meeting took place on 18 May 1994.\n\nDuring the summer and autumn of 1994, further comments were exchanged. On 26 and 27 October 1994 a preparatory meeting was held in order to plan the schedule for the main hearing. Between December 1994 and June 1995, further views were exchanged, among other things on the Sami villages' request for an inspection.\n\nBy a decision of 22 June 1995, the District Court rejected the request for an inspection on the ground that the villages had not shown that an inspection of certain properties was necessary for an examination of whether they had a right to winter grazing on the land in question.\n\nThe parties were summoned for the main hearing at the beginning of August 1995. On 1 September 1995 some more landowners initiated a similar action against the Sami villages. This case was joined to the other two.\n\nThe main hearing started on 18 September and ended on 25 October 1995. It lasted for 16 days. The District Court heard a large number of experts and witnesses and had regard to substantial documentary evidence. During the hearing, as well as on seven previous occasions, the court struck out the case in regard to some of the landowners following withdrawal of the action on their part. The three joined cases eventually comprised property belonging to 571 landowners.\n\nHaving examined the developments of the Sami culture and reindeer herding since prehistoric times, the District Court issued a 192-page judgment on 21 February 1996. It found that, from the 16th to the late 19th century, there had not been any winter grazing which had established a right for the Sami to such grazing on the relevant properties and that, from the late 19th century, the actual winter grazing, as annually recorded by the so‑called Lapp bailiffs (lappfogdar), had not lasted long enough in the respective parishes to create a right to grazing on those properties based on prescription from time immemorial, such prescription requiring at least 90 years' use of the land. For these reasons, the Sami villages could not claim a right to use the properties under the various laws, including the Reindeer Husbandry Act presently in force. Moreover, the court found that a right to real property could not legally be established through “custom” and that a right to winter grazing on the properties in question could not be based on the provisions of the UN Convention and the Instrument of Government. The court therefore concluded that there was no right of the Sami villages to reindeer grazing on the plaintiffs' land without a valid contract and accordingly gave judgment in favour of the landowners. The court ordered the Sami villages jointly to pay the plaintiffs' legal costs, amounting to approximately 4,000,000 Swedish kronor (SEK; about 400,000 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn 15 March 1996 the Sami villages appealed to the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) of Nedre Norrland. They demanded that the District Court's judgment be quashed, that the landowners' action be rejected and that the decision on litigation costs not be enforced. They completed their appeal on 2 September 1996.\n\nOn 8 November 1996 the landowners responded and requested that the Sami villages not be allowed to invoke circumstances in their defence that had not been presented to the District Court. In a submission of 20 December 1996, the villages, on their part, made an additional demand that the District Court's judgment be set aside and the case remitted to that court on the ground that a procedural error had occurred. During the following months, the parties exchanged views on these and other matters. The landowners submitted their comments on the villages' additional demand on 2 June 1997.\n\nBy a decision of 16 June 1997, the Court of Appeal ruled on twelve different procedural issues. Among other things, it rejected the Sami villages' request that the appealed judgment be set aside and the case remitted. It also rejected the landowners' request that the villages not be allowed to invoke certain circumstances in their defence, with one exception. Thus, the court did not allow the villages to argue that winter grazing without protests from landowners for a period of less than 90 years would qualify for a continued right to such grazing based on prescription from time immemorial or the provisions of the reindeer grazing and reindeer husbandry acts. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal rejected the Sami villages' requests for an inspection of the locus in quo and for an order against the landowners to produce maps of the areas concerned. In its reasons for the various rulings, the court referred, inter alia, to the provisions of the Code of Judicial Procedure (Rättegångsbalken) concerning the conditions for invoking new circumstances and evidence not previously examined by the District Court.\n\nOn 18 June 1997 the parties were ordered to complete their respective actions by the end of October 1997.\n\nOn 24 September 1997 the Sami villages claimed that there was a procedural hindrance (rättegångshinder) as they lacked the capacity to act as parties in relation to the issue concerned by the proceedings in question. By a decision of 4 November 1997, the Court of Appeal rejected this claim, stating that, under the provisions of the Reindeer Husbandry Act, they had the necessary legal capacity. On 1 December 1997 the villages appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen). At their request, the Court of Appeal granted the villages an extension of the time-limit set for the completion of their appeal until the Supreme Court had rendered its decision on the procedural issue. By a decision of 18 February 1999, the Supreme Court refused the villages leave to appeal.\n\nIn a submission of 4 March 1999, the Sami villages demanded that the State, through the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern), intervene on their side in the proceedings. At the end of May 1999, the Chancellor informed the Court of Appeal that he did not intend to apply to participate in the proceedings.\n\nIn March and July 1999 the Sami villages were ordered to complete their appeal, which they did on 11 October 1999, after having been granted extensions of the time-limits set. Shortly thereafter, the landowners were ordered to submit the means of evidence they invoked, which they did on 21 February 2000, also following time-limit extensions.\n\nIn January 2000 the landowners applied for the Sami villages' appeal to be dismissed and in February 2000 the villages reiterated their demand that the District Court's judgment be quashed and the case remitted. By a decision of 19 December 2000, the Court of Appeal rejected these requests.\n\nOn 7 November 2000 the Sami villages requested that the court obtain an opinion from an expert (sakkunnig). Following the landowners' objection and the villages' further comments, the court rejected this request on 8 March 2001.\n\nIn January 2001 the court ordered the parties to make submissions on the question of which landowners were to be considered opposite parties in the appellate proceedings. The Sami villages submitted several comments between January and April 2001 and the landowners made their submissions in May and August 2001, after extensions of the time-limits set.\n\nOn 31 May 2001, having interpreted one of the landowners' submissions as a motion for dismissal of the Sami villages' appeal, the Court of Appeal rejected that motion. On 18 June 2001 the villages adduced some written evidence not previously presented. The landowners objected to that evidence but, by a decision of 5 September 2001, the court allowed the villages to present it.\n\nThe main hearing in the Court of Appeal was held between 1 and 31 October 2001 and lasted 16 days. The appellate court heard the same evidence as the District Court and, as already mentioned, some additional written evidence introduced by the Sami villages.\n\nFollowing some landowners' withdrawal of their action and the Idre Nya Sami village's withdrawal of its appeal, the Court of Appeal, by decisions of 8 October and 16 November 2001, struck out the case and set aside the District Court's judgment – including the Idre Nya Sami village's liability for litigation costs – in so far as it concerned these same parties.\n\nBy a judgment of 15 February 2002, the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court's judgment and ordered the applicants to pay the plaintiffs' legal costs in the appellate proceedings, amounting to approximately SEK 2,900,000 (about EUR 290,000).\n\nThe Court of Appeal initially referred to the conclusion by the Supreme Court in the so-called “Taxed Mountains Case” (Skattefjällsmålet, NJA 1981, p. 1) that the rights pertaining to reindeer herding were exhaustively regulated by the Reindeer Husbandry Act. Consequently, the right of winter grazing was dependent on the conditions for prescription from time immemorial being met, those conditions having been regulated in the old Land Code (Jordabalken) of 1734.\n\nAs regards prescription from time immemorial and the burden and standard of proof in this respect, the Court of Appeal stated the following: “Under Chapter 15, section 4 of the old Land Code, the following applied to proof of prescription from time immemorial. 'If someone pleads prescription from time immemorial and fault is found with this claim, let him then show by means of old letters and writings deemed sufficient in law, or by means of credible men who have good local knowledge and can bear witness, on oath, that they neither know themselves nor have heard from others that the situation has ever been different. If he is unable to do this, the prescriptive right shall then be without force and effect.' According to the preparatory works for the 1928 Reindeer Grazing Act and the [1971] Reindeer Husbandry Act, in cases subject to dispute, the question of whether a right to winter grazing applies in a certain area is to be examined by a court on the basis of the evidence that is required under general law for proof of prescription from time immemorial (see Government Bill 1928:43, p. 71, and Government Bill 1971:51, p. 158). The burden of proof that winter grazing has taken place on the property owner's land to such an extent that the Sami villages have a right to continued winter grazing may therefore be deemed to rest with the Sami villages. In this case, the Sami villages claim that a right to winter grazing based on prescription from time immemorial has come into being as Sami have been in Härjedalen since prehistoric times, as reindeer were early on associated with the Sami culture, as reindeer management took on a completely nomadic form in the late sixteenth century or, at all events, during the seventeenth century, and it can be assumed that even then, in the winter, depending on the weather conditions and access to food, the reindeer belonging to the Sami wandered in search of food, and as the custom that developed at that time has endured until modern times. However, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, for a right to winter grazing on the disputed lands to be deemed to have arisen on the basis of prescription from time immemorial, it must be required in addition that the results of the investigation indicate with sufficient strength that Sami have used the lands in question or parts of them for winter grazing for their reindeer with at least some regularity without hindrance, that is, without objection from other holders of rights.” The court further held that account had to be taken of the special features of reindeer husbandry. The herding required much space and necessitated movement between various grazing areas. The right to winter grazing based on prescription could not require that reindeer grazed in a particular area every winter. However, a basic condition for that right was that the area had been used in such a way that every instance of grazing could be seen as part of a recurring pattern, although absence from the area in question could be more or less prolonged.\n\nThe Court of Appeal examined extensive evidence dating back several hundred years and drew the following conclusions. As regards the period before the entry into force of the Reindeer Grazing Act of 1886 (most notably, the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries), it had not been shown that free winter grazing – that is, in the absence of contracts or the authorities' permission – had taken place in Härjedalen. On the contrary, the individual landowners had protested against reindeer grazing on their land. At the time of the enactment of the 1886 and 1898 Acts, the disputes between the domiciled population and the nomadic Sami about the use of the land at issue had been particularly sensitive in Härjedalen, and the investigation did not show that any winter grazing had occurred outside the boundaries of the “reindeer grazing mountains”. According to the evidence presented with respect to the situation in the 20th century, grazing outside these mountains had existed during wintertime only in limited areas and protests from landowners had been commonplace.\n\nThe appellate court thus found, in agreement with the District Court, that, before the 20th century, there had not been such winter grazing outside the reindeer grazing mountains which, together with the grazing that had taken place during the 20th century, could create a right to use the relevant properties on the basis of prescription from time immemorial. The longest period in the latter century during which winter grazing had occurred in one area without landowners' objections was 50 years, thus insufficient to establish a right based on prescription.\n\nThe applicants appealed to the Supreme Court on 19 March 2002. Their appeal was completed on 22 May 2002. In the following months, they submitted documents as to the question of who was to represent them before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn 29 April 2004 the Supreme Court refused the applicants leave to appeal.\n\nThe Sami Fund (Samefonden) has granted the applicants a loan of SEK 14,700,000 (approximately EUR 1,470,000) to pay the litigation costs incurred in the domestic proceedings. The loan, which is free of interest, is due on 30 November 2010.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr J.

Doğan, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 11 June 2012 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1969 and lives in İstanbul.\n\nOn 25 September 1990, when the applicant was a conscript in the army, a clash broke out between the security forces and a group of terrorists. During the incident the applicant was severely wounded by gunshots. Subsequently, he was treated in different military hospitals. According to a medical report, dated 14 November 1991, the applicant’s work capability had been reduced by 33%. Consequently, on 2 April 1992 he was declared to be suffering from a permanent disability and discharged from the army. He was also awarded a sixth-degree disability pension.\n\nIn the following years the applicant started suffering from persistent headaches and dizziness, and had sleeping problems. In 2004 a CT scan revealed an unidentified metallic object in the left orbital area. Subsequently, in 2007, the applicant was admitted to the neurosurgery department of the GATA Military Hospital and another CT scan revealed that he had a bullet in his head, measuring 15 x 10 mm. The doctors stated that removing the bullet was potentially life-threatening.\n\nOn 19 September 2007 the applicant applied to the Ministry of Defence for compensation in respect of his injury. He alleged that, on account of medical negligence, the bullet in his head had remained unnoticed and that he had sustained further pecuniary damage as this fact had not been taken into account in calculating his disability pension.\n\nFollowing tacit dismissal of the claim by the administrative authorities, on 16 January 2008 the applicant instituted two separate actions in the Supreme Military Administrative Court, one for the pecuniary damage and the other for the non-pecuniary damage he had sustained on account of the bullet which had been found in his head in 2007.\n\nOn 21 January and 18 February 2009 respectively the Supreme Military Administrative Court, by a majority, rejected both actions as being out of time. In both decisions the court held that notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had not been aware of the bullet in his head until 2007, pursuant to section 43(1) of the Supreme Military Administrative Court Act, his compensation claims should have been lodged within five years of the incident.\n\nOn 22 April 2009 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected a rectification request lodged by the applicant.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-76f12", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator1", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 37222/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Bekir Güven Altınay (“the applicant”), on 16 August 2004.\n\nThe Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged in particular that he had suffered discrimination owing to changes to the university entrance system and the lack of transitional clauses. He contended that because he held a vocational high school diploma, the new selection system had put him at a disadvantage in relation to candidates from ordinary high schools and also in relation to students entering higher education in the years before and after the year in which the new system had been introduced. On these points he relied on Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n\nOn 25 June 2008 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided that the Chamber would rule on the admissibility and the merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1 of the Convention).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Antalya.\n\nIn 1995 he enrolled at a vocational high school specialised in communication. He said that he had intended to obtain a high-school diploma and then go on to study communication science at university with an eye to becoming a journalist. At the time, students holding vocational school diplomas were able, after competing on an equal footing with diploma-holders from ordinary high schools, to apply for four-year degree programmes in university faculties of communication sciences. The graduates of such faculties generally went on to hold executive posts in the media.\n\nOn 30 July 1998, when the applicant was beginning his last year at his vocational high school, the Higher Education Council (Yüksek Öğretim Kurulu – “the Council”) issued a circular based on Law no. 2547 introducing a new system amending the rules on admission to university, particularly the national entrance examination to higher education (Öğrenci Seçme Sınavı – ÖSS). For the entrance examination to the faculties of communication sciences, the final mark was made up of 79% of the marks obtained in the different examination papers and 21% of the average marks obtained at upper secondary level. The new system applied to the average obtained at upper secondary level a 0.5 weighting for candidates from ordinary high schools who had acquired knowledge in fields which, according to the circular, corresponded to the subjects taught in the faculties of communication sciences, and a 0.2 weighting for candidates from vocational high schools specialised in communication who had acquired knowledge in subjects “which did not correspond” to those taught in the said faculties.\n\nThe applicant considered that applying a weighting to the average marks used for calculating the results of the entrance examination gave an advantage to students from ordinary high schools over those from vocational schools specialised in communication. In his view the new selection system tended to direct holders of diplomas from such vocational schools into two-year technical training programmes in higher technical colleges (Meslek Yüksek Okulu), graduates from which could not, in principle, aspire to executive posts in the media.\n\nThe applicant then requested authorisation to leave the vocational high school in which he was enrolled in order to take remote ordinary high-school (açık öğretim lisesi) classes with a view to obtaining a general high school diploma.\n\nHis request was rejected by the Ministry of Education on the ground that the legislation did not allow students to move from a vocational or technical college to an ordinary high school.\n\nOn 6 June 1999 the applicant, having obtained his high school diploma, sat the national entrance examination for higher education. On 6 September 1999 he received his results, which were insufficient for access to a faculty of communication sciences. He calculated that had it not been for the 0.2 weighting on his average high school marks, that is to say without the changes introduced under the new system, the marks which he had obtained in the examination would have been sufficient for him to enrol in the faculty of communication sciences of his choice.\n\nOn 20 September 1999 he applied to the Supreme Administrative Court for judicial review of the decision in question. Relying on the principle of equality among holders of the different types of high school diplomas, he complained of the unforeseeable nature of the changes introduced under the reform carried out during his final year in secondary education and of the lack of a transitional period and retroactivity clause.\n\nThe State Counsel at the Supreme Administrative Court asked the relevant Section of the Supreme Administrative Court to declare void the clauses relating to implementation of the 30 July 1998 circular. He contended that the immediate implementation of the new rules on vocational guidance and the lack of a transitional period had had a negative impact on vocational high school students. According to the State Counsel, the authorities should have laid down transitional measures to protect such students, who had chosen their educational pathway before the new measures, and should have taken advantage of this period to provide students with more detailed information on the various vocational options.\n\nOn 1 May 2001 the 8th Section of the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s application. It began by explaining that the changes introduced in the 1998-1999 academic year provided an advantage as regards university entrance to students who wished to take a university course in a field closely related to their secondary studies. It considered that the new system took account of the changes in overall economic and social conditions, for example the new requirement of good marks in mathematics and literature for studies in law, public administration and political and social sciences.\n\nAs regards the lack of a transitional period, the 8th Section of the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the immediate implementation of the new provisions had been geared to securing equal treatment for all students and prompt improvements in educational standards at the higher education level. It also stated that the Ministry of Education had granted the students in question, as a transitional measure, the possibility of transferring mid-year to a high school which corresponded more closely to their vocational options.\n\nBy a judgment of 20 November 2003, served on the applicant on 25 February 2004, the combined sections of the Supreme Administrative Court, endorsing the arguments of the 8th section, rejected an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant.\n\nIn the meantime, as of September 2000, by which date the applicant had already completed his secondary studies for over a year, the Higher Education Council introduced a facility for transferring, under specified conditions, from a vocational to an ordinary high school, having realised that the lack of transitional measures had been negatively impacting students from vocational schools.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Bekir Güven Altınay - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1981, lives in Antalya, enrolled at a vocational high school specialised in communication in 1995, seeking to become a journalist", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Bekir Güven Altınay", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "43-44", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Antalya / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "High School Diploma", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "The Agent - Representative of the Turkish Government in the proceedings", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Lawyer", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 5}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Turkish Government", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Agent", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "The State Counsel - State Counsel at the Supreme Administrative Court who asked for the 30 July 1998 circular clauses to be declared void", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 5}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Lawyer", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Supreme Administrative Court", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "State Counsel", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}]}

Clerides and Mr A. Demetriades, two lawyers practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had deprived him of his home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 26 September 2002 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant was born in Peristerona, a village in the District of Famagusta in northern Cyprus. He lived in Famagusta with his family in a four-bedroom apartment with an unobstructed view towards the sea, which he claimed that he owned. This apartment, located at no. 128 of the commercial and touristic main street named Kennedy Avenue, was indicated by no. 703 on a building erected upon a building site with plot no. 937 of block C and sheet/plan 33/21.2.3. It was registered in the name of the applicant under registration no. 1057.\n\nThe applicant further claimed that at the time of the 1974 Turkish invasion he was the owner of land in Famagusta on which was located an Intercommunal Secondary Grammar school, known as the “Centre of Higher Studies”. This land covered a total area of 6,299 m², on plot no. 900 of block D and sheet/plan 24/59W2. It was registered in the name of the applicant under registration no. D-4840. On this land the applicant had erected a three-storey building, which had a total area of 2,020 m², comprising a basement, ground floor and two vertical floors above it. The applicant submitted that he was the owner and headmaster of the above-mentioned school, the premises of which are now part of the “Eastern Mediterranean University”.\n\nIn support of his claims to ownership, the applicant produced the following documents:\n\nan agreement reached on 1 September 1968 between a certain G. Nicolaides and Mr Takis Saveriades (a member of the applicant's family) for the sale of an apartment located on the seventh floor of a flat on the Famagusta coast;\n\na certificate issued on 28 November 2002 by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus stating that the applicant was the owner of a flat without parking space, located in Famagusta, Kennedy Avenue, registered under plot no. 937, sheet/plan 3/21.2.3;\n\na certificate issued on 11 September 2001 by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus stating that the applicant was the owner of a field with an unregistered building, located in Famagusta, Salaminas Avenue, registered under plot no. 900, sheet/plan 24/59;\n\na building permit issued on 11 September 1963 concerning plot no. 900, sheet/plan 24/59\n\nAt the time of the 1974 Turkish invasion, the applicant and his family fled to southern Cyprus. He claimed that since then he had been deprived of his property rights, all his property being located in the area which is under the occupation and the control of the Turkish military authorities. The latter prevented him from having access to and from using and possessing his home and property in Famagusta as well as from practising his profession there.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Christos Saveriades - The applicant, Cypriot national born in 1938, lives in Nicosia, claimed owner of properties in Famagusta including apartment and school building", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Christos Saveriades", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "86-87", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Nicosia / Cyprus", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Cyprus", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "Married", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Headmaster", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Eastern Mediterranean University", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Headmaster", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr C.

Drzewicki, of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 17 December 2002 the Fourth Section declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Częstochowa, Poland.\n\nIn June 1995, on his way to work, the applicant bought a bottle of sparkling mineral water. While he was opening it, the bottle exploded and its metal cap hit the applicant’s left eye. The accident, despite the subsequent surgeries and medical treatment, resulted in the applicant’s loss of vision in his left eye. He was declared an invalid and was granted a disability pension by the Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych).\n\nIn August 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings for compensation and pension against the producer of the mineral water. He submitted medical certificates issued by the Częstochowa and Katowice Hospitals which treated his injury.\n\nOn 23 October 1997 the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki w Częstochowie) exempted the applicant from the court fees.\n\nOn 15 November and 15 December 1997 the trial court held hearings.\n\nIn December 1997 the “S” assurance company joined the proceedings as an intervener.\n\nIn 1998 the trial court held four hearings at which it heard witnesses.\n\nOn 8 December 1998 the court, sitting in camera, ordered a medical expert opinion.\n\nOn 18 May 1999 the court received the opinion.\n\nOn 25 May 1999 the court, sitting in camera, ordered the Social Security Board to provide a copy of the applicant’s file.\n\nBetween 24 November 1998 and 7 September 1999 no hearings were held.\n\nAt the subsequent hearings held on 8 September 1999, 12 January and 14 June 2000 the court heard witnesses and ordered the preparation of new expert opinions.\n\nOn 13 December 2000 the trial court held a hearing at which it asked for another expert medical opinion to be prepared.\n\nOn 10 April 2001 the court received the expert opinion. The intervener challenged it.\n\nAt the hearing held on 20 June 2001 the court requested an expert opinion concerning the applicant’s pension.\n\nThe expert submitted the opinion on 31 January 2002. Again, the intervener challenged the opinion.\n\nThe next hearing, which was held on 20 March 2002, was adjourned sine die. The court ordered another expert opinion.\n\nOn 24 May 2002 the opinion was submitted to the court. Subsequently, the intervener challenged it.\n\nOn 27 September 2002 the trial court held a hearing.\n\nOn 30 September 2002 the Częstochowa Regional Court gave judgment. The defendant was found liable for the damage sustained by the applicant. The court awarded the applicant PLN 85,000 in compensation but dismissed his claim for pension.\n\nBoth parties appealed against this judgment.\n\nOn 4 April 2003 the applicant was exempted from the court-fees in the appeal procedure.

Inal, a lawyer practising in Aydın. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 5 January 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Söke.\n\nAt the time of the events the applicant was employed as an electrician in a private company.\n\nOn 2 August 1991 the scaffolding on which the applicant was working collapsed and resulted in the applicant’s total disability.\n\nOn 16 September 1991 the applicant brought an action for damages in the Söke Labour Court.\n\nOn 3 February 1994 the Söke Labour Court partially upheld the applicant’s claims and awarded 10,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) for pecuniary damage and TRL 30,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage, plus interest at the statutory rate, running from the date of the incident.\n\nThe defendant appealed.\n\nOn 11 October 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the Söke Labour Court. It found that the Labour Court had incorrectly calculated the amount of compensation and interest.\n\nThe Söke Labour Court rendered its second judgment on 12 September 1995, awarding the same amounts as before.\n\nOn 23 January 1996 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment. It held that, although the Söke Labour Court had decided to conform to the Court of Cassation’s previous decision, it had reached the same conclusion as before.\n\nOn 29 November 1996 the applicant lodged an additional claim with the same court, requesting further damages. These two cases were later joined.\n\nThe Söke Labour Court issued its third judgment on 12 June 1997. It upheld the applicant’s additional claim lodged on 29 November 1996 and granted TRL 1,574,919,236 for pecuniary damage and TRL 30,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage, plus interest at the statutory rate, running from the date of the judgment and from the date of the incident respectively.\n\nThe defendant appealed.\n\nOn 21 October 1997 the Court of Cassation quashed the Labour Court’s decision for the third time on the same ground as before.\n\nOn 3 November 1998 the Söke Labour Court issued its fourth judgment, dismissing the applicant’s pecuniary damage claims as a whole. In its reasoning, the court held that the Court of Cassation’s assessment method was inapplicable to the incident. It also pointed out that its previous decision regarding the applicant’s non-pecuniary damage claims had become final on 3 February 1994 as the defendant had not challenged it.\n\nThe applicant appealed.\n\nOn 4 May 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the first instance court’s decision on the ground that it had not calculated the applicant’s damage in compliance with the principles stated in its judgment of 11 November 1994.\n\nOn 17 May 2001 the Söke Labour Court awarded the applicant TRL 1,579,135,521 for pecuniary damage plus interest at the statutory rate, running from the date of the judgment.\n\nBoth parties appealed.\n\nOn 8 November 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the Söke Labour Court’s judgment for the fifth time, criticising the method of calculation applied by the Labour Court.\n\nOn 16 February 2006 the Labour Court awarded the applicant 1,579 New Turkish liras (YTL) for his pecuniary damage claims, plus interest at the statutory rate, running from the date of the judgment.\n\nThe applicant appealed.\n\nOn 12 June 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld the Söke Labour Court’s judgment in full without giving any reasons of its own.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Hakkı Karadavut - Turkish national applicant, born in 1963, lives in Söke, former electrician who became totally disabled after a scaffolding collapse in 1991", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Hakkı Karadavut", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "61-62", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Söke / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-62f5c", "number_of_subjects": 5, "annotator": "annotator2", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 47114/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Sean Marc Taylor-Sabori (“the applicant”), on 1 October 1998.\n\nThe applicant, was granted legal aid, but never actually claimed it. He was represented by Bobbetts Mackan, a firm of solicitors practising in Bristol. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.A. Whomersley, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant complains, principally, under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention that the interception of his pager messages by the police and subsequent reference to them at his trial amounted to an unjustified interference with his private life and correspondence which was not “in accordance with the law” and in respect of which there was no remedy under English law.\n\nThe application was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nOn 27 June 2000 the Court declared the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention inadmissible. On 29 May 2001 it declared his complaints under Articles 8 and 13 admissible. The Court decided, after consulting the parties, to dispense with a hearing (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nBetween August 1995 and the applicant’s arrest on 21 January 1996, he was the target of surveillance by the police. Using a “clone” of the applicant’s pager, the police were able to intercept messages sent to him. The pager system used by the applicant and intercepted by the police operated as follows: The sender, whether in the United Kingdom or overseas, would telephone the pager bureau in the United Kingdom via the public telephone network. The pager operator would key the message into a computer and read it back to the sender to confirm its accuracy. The computer message was transmitted via the public telephone system to the pager terminal, from where it was relayed by radio to one of four regional base stations and thence, again by radio, simultaneously to the applicant’s and the police’s clone pagers, which displayed the message in text.\n\nThe applicant was arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply a controlled drug. The prosecution alleged that he had been one of the principal organisers of the importation to the United Kingdom from Amsterdam of over 22,000 ecstasy tablets worth approximately GBP 268,000. He was tried, along with a number of alleged co-conspirators, at Bristol Crown Court in September 1997.\n\nPart of the prosecution case against the applicant consisted of the contemporaneous written notes of the pager messages which had been transcribed by the police. The applicant’s counsel submitted that these notes should not be admitted in evidence because the police had not had a warrant under section 2 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) for the interception of the pager messages. However, the trial judge ruled that, since the messages had been transmitted via a private system, the 1985 Act did not apply and no warrant had been necessary.\n\nThe applicant pleaded not guilty. He was convicted and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant appealed against conviction and sentence. One of the grounds was the admission in evidence of the pager messages. The Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal on 13 September 1998, upheld the trial judge’s ruling that the messages had been intercepted at the point of transmission on the private radio system, so that the 1985 Act did not apply and the messages were admissible despite having been intercepted without a warrant.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Sean Marc Taylor-Sabori - The applicant, United Kingdom national, convicted of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Sean Marc Taylor-Sabori", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Bristol / United Kingdom", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Drug trafficker", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr C.A.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 11 February 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who is a retired non-commissioned officer, was born in 1959 and lives in Osmaniye.\n\nOn 29 June 2002 the applicant attempted to enter the social facilities of the Osmaniye Gendarmerie Commandership, which was a right granted to him under Article 664 § 4 of the Internal Service Regulation of the Turkish Armed Forces (“the Internal Service Regulation”) as a retired non‑commissioned officer. He was, however, not admitted on the basis of an order of the Turkish General Staff, prohibiting him from entering any social facilities of the Armed Forces. The applicant was not provided any further information as to the reason for this prohibition.\n\nThe applicant subsequently filed an action against the Ministry of Defence with the Supreme Military Administrative Court and requested the annulment of the order of the Turkish General Staff. The applicant emphasised that he was not able to duly defend himself against the impugned decision due to his lack of access to the secret information and documents relied on by the Turkish General Staff.\n\nIn its reply, the Ministry of Defence stated that the applicant had been banned from using the said facilities for engaging in activities proscribed under Article 664 § 4 (c) of the Internal Service Regulation. It submitted certain classified documents in support of its decision.\n\nOn 22 April 2004 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s request. It stated that information and documents the confidentiality of which was required and necessitated for the performance of military service could not be disclosed to the applicant.

Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in Oxfordshire. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant mainly complained under Article 5 §§ 3 and 5 of the Convention about his pre-trial detention and under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention about his summary trial before his Commanding Officer.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nIt was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 20 March 2001 the application was declared partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) and the present case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Durham. At the relevant time he was a Lance Corporal in the British army stationed in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn August 1996 he was reported to his Commanding Officer on a wounding charge, which incident had allegedly occurred in May 1996. On 21 November 1996 he was arrested on two unrelated charges of failing to attend and disobeying a lawful command. On 22 November 1996 he appeared, on the orders of his Commanding Officer, on the latter two charges and he was reduced to the ranks. On the same day he was also remanded for an abstract of evidence (see paragraph 21 below) to be compiled on a charge of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.\n\nIn early December 1996 he went missing from his unit. On 27 January 1997 he was arrested in England by the civilian police, charged with aggravated burglary and handed over to the military authorities. When it was discovered that he had been absent without leave, he was placed in close arrest in the guardroom of Catterick garrison. On 28 January 1997 he was escorted under close arrest back to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Government maintained that a copy of the information pamphlet entitled “The rights of a soldier charged with an offence under the Army Act 1955” (1994 edition) would have been available to the applicant at Catterick garrison and would have been provided to him against signature of a form acknowledging receipt. Since the relevant disciplinary file was lost, the Government could not provide a copy of the form. The applicant accepted that he received a copy of the pamphlet while in close arrest in Northern Ireland and that it was likely to have been the 1994 version of the pamphlet.\n\nOn 30 January 1997 he appeared before his Commanding Officer who remanded him in close arrest and ordered an abstract of evidence to be compiled on the absence without leave charge with a view to that Officer applying for power to award extended detention (paragraphs 21 and 24 below). No such application was in fact made. During that hearing the applicant received a copy of the charge sheet (the absence without leave charge). The applicant maintained, and the Government denied, that at that same meeting he was asked by his Commanding Officer whether he would be pleading guilty or not guilty and that he had indicated the former.\n\nOn 13 February 1997 the applicant appeared before his Commanding Officer when the latter read the charge of absence without leave and formally asked the applicant whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty. He pleaded guilty and he was awarded 28 days’ military detention. On that day he was also remanded for trial on the wounding charge. The applicant claimed that he was not afforded the opportunity of electing trial by court-martial whereas the Government submitted that he would have been given this option by the Commanding Officer before the finding of guilty was recorded on 13 February 1997.\n\nOn 26 February 1997 the applicant appeared before a Magistrates’ Court in Newcastle (England) on the aggravated burglary charge and was remanded on bail until 28 March 1997. He completed his military sentence of imprisonment on 7 March 1997. He was then informed by his Commanding Officer that he was to be retained in close arrest until his trial by court-martial on the wounding charge. He was then released to open arrest on 12 March 1997 following representations by his civilian solicitor. In March 1997 the civilian prosecuting authorities discontinued the burglary proceedings. In June 1997 a notice of temporary discontinuance issued as regards the court-martial proceedings on the wounding charge. No further action on that charge has been taken against the applicant who was subsequently administratively discharged in August 1997 for reasons not related to the afore-mentioned charges or conviction.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Albert Thompson - The applicant, UK national born in 1965, lives in Durham, was a Lance Corporal in the British army stationed in Northern Ireland, faced various charges including wounding and absence without leave", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Albert Thompson", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "59-60", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Durham / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr J.

Hasdemir, a lawyer practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 21 October 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). The case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Elazığ.\n\nOn 20 June 1991 the applicant was seriously injured in an explosion of a bomb placed in the garden of the Military barracks in Gaziosmanpaşa district of İstanbul. He was ten years old at the time of the events.\n\nOn 10 February 1992 the applicant’s father, acting as his legal guardian, filed a petition with the Ministry of Internal Affairs requesting compensation for the damage the applicant had sustained. The Ministry of Internal Affairs rejected this request on 15 April 1992.\n\nOn 3 June 1992 the applicant’s father brought an action for compensation before the İstanbul Administrative Court against the Ministry of Internal Affairs (hereinafter “the respondent”).\n\nOn 16 June 1992 the case was notified to the respondent which submitted its observations on 11 August 1992.\n\nOn 3 March 1993 the İstanbul Administrative Court dismissed the respondent’s preliminary objection.\n\nBetween 3 March 1993 and 4 December 1994 the first-instance court took certain procedural decisions on 10 December 1993, 27 June 1994 and 16 September 1994.\n\nOn 4 December 1994 the İstanbul Administrative Court considered that there was neither fault nor negligence attributable to the authorities and dismissed the case.\n\nOn 30 January 1995 the applicant appealed against the aforementioned decision and requested the suspension of the execution of the judgment. On 30 January 1995 the applicant paid the expenses pertaining to the appeal procedure. The applicant was warned that the amount paid was insufficient and on 30 March 1995 he paid the remaining costs of the appeal procedure.\n\nOn 3 May 1995 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request for a suspension of the execution of the judgment of 4 December 1994.\n\nOn 16 November 1995 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the first-instance court. The court referred to the doctrine of “social risk”, which did not require the establishment of any causal link between the harmful action and the loss, and reasoned that the damage caused by terrorism should be shared by the society as a whole in accordance with the principles of “justice” and “social state”.\n\nOn 15 March 1996 the respondent requested the rectification of the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\nOn 9 March 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the request of the respondent.\n\nOn 30 September 1998 the Istanbul Administrative Court decided to abide by the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\nOn 27 November 1998 the case-file was sent to an expert.

Creighton, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant, serving a sentence of mandatory life imprisonment, alleged that the Parole Board did not provide the guarantees and procedures required by Article 5 § 4 when examining whether he should be released and that he had no enforceable right to compensation for any breach of his rights as required by Article 5 § 5.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 23 September 2003, the Court declared the remainder of application admissible.\n\nThe applicant filed observations on just satisfaction and the Government replied (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1959 and is serving a sentence of life imprisonment in HM Prison Doncaster.\n\nThe applicant was convicted in or around 1981 for the murder of an acquaintance. He was sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment, and his tariff (the minimum period of imprisonment required to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence) was set at 12 years.\n\nAt the time of the applicant's latest Parole Board review in 2001, he was detained in HM Prison Wymott as a “Category C” prisoner (prisoners being given a security category classification ranging from Category A (highest risk) to Category D (suitable for open conditions)). The Parole Board recommended that the applicant should be transferred to open conditions, and that his detention should be reviewed after two years. By letter dated 6 July 2001 the Secretary of State informed the Prison Service that he did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation for transfer to open conditions, and that the next review should begin after 12 months. In the letter to the applicant which accompanied the decision it was stated that: “... [t]he Secretary of State attaches particular weight to the psychologist's report, it has highlighted in some detail, the need for further exploration of your insight into, and responsibility for, the index offence and the apparent lack of empathy towards the victim.”\n\nIn June 2001 the applicant was transferred to HM Prison Manchester. He claimed that he did not receive notification of the parole decision until sometime after 13 September 2001. The Government stated that a copy of the decision letter was sent to the applicant on 6 July 2001 and a copy to the solicitors then acting for the applicant on 7 August 2001. When the applicant changed his solicitors in September 2001, the authorities sent a copy of the decision to the new solicitors.\n\nThe applicant stated that he wanted to seek judicial review of the decision, but was unable to find a solicitor who was prepared to act on his behalf. His then solicitors gave advice that judicial review stood little prospect of success as the reports recommending a move to open conditions had been slightly ambiguous, there were a number of very unfavourable reports and the Secretary of State had given extensive reasons for rejecting the recommended move.\n\nThe applicant's first Parole Board oral hearing under new arrangements was scheduled for November 2003. At the applicant's request, it was deferred until May 2004 to allow the applicant time to complete certain courses identified in the reports for the Parole Board review.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Robert Edward Hill - The applicant, born in 1959, UK national serving mandatory life imprisonment for murder, convicted around 1981", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Robert Edward Hill", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "65-66", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "HM Prison Doncaster / Doncaster / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "HM Prison Doncaster", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr S.

The court reasoned that the applicant had not furnished any bank document, such as receipts indicating withdrawal of money, capable of supporting her allegations.

Tekeli, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 26 May 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Izmir.\n\nThe facts of the case, as presented by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nUntil 1987 the applicant worked as a primary school teacher in Izmir.\n\nOn 30 March 1983 he was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nFrom 30 March 1983 to 30 September 1987, he was suspended from his post on account of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nIn 1984 the Diyarbakır Martial Court convicted the applicant under Article 141 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.\n\nBy a decision of 30 September 1987, the Ministry of National Education dismissed the applicant from his employment. It reasoned that the applicant was no longer eligible for the civil service since he failed to fulfil the requirements of the post as prescribed by Article 48 § A-5 of Law no. 657.\n\nOn 12 April 1991 Article 141 of the Criminal Code was repealed by Law no. 3713 (the Anti-Terror Law).\n\nOn 4 December 1991 the Izmir Assize Court ordered the removal of the applicant's conviction under Article 141 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 15 September 1992 the applicant filed a petition with the administrative authorities and requested his reinstatement to his previous post.\n\nOn 31 December 1993 the applicant was reinstated to the post of primary school teacher at a primary school in Konak.\n\nOn 8 February 1994 the applicant filed a petition with the principal of the primary school. He requested to be given the rights and earnings which he was denied during his suspension and dismissal periods.\n\nThe principal of the primary school transmitted the applicant's petition to the Konak District National Education Directorate.\n\nBy a decision dated 11 April 1994, the Ministry of National Education dismissed the applicant's request.\n\nOn 9 May 1994 the Konak District National Education Directorate informed the applicant about the Ministry's decision.\n\nOn 30 May 1994 the applicant filed an action with the Izmir Administrative Court, seeking compensation for the damage he had suffered as a result of his allegedly unlawful suspension and dismissal. He further requested to be granted the rights and salaries of which he had been deprived during those periods.\n\nOn 20 December 1996 the Izmir Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's claim. It reasoned that the decision of the administrative authorities concerning his reinstatement to his previous post would not enable him to claim the rights and earnings which were denied him during the suspension and dismissal periods.\n\nOn 6 April 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for appeal. It opined that the reinstatement of the applicant did not give him the right to recuperate rights and earnings for the suspension and dismissal period.\n\nOn 31 August 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court's decision was served on the applicant.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Oğuz Atakan Köseoğlu - The applicant, Turkish national born in 1951, former primary school teacher from Izmir who was suspended, dismissed, and later reinstated", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Oğuz Atakan Köseoğlu", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "73-74", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Konak / Izmir / Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 5}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Primary school teacher", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Primary school in Konak", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Ms A.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-ded9a", "number_of_subjects": 6, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 47335/06) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Arthur Collins Redfearn (“the applicant”), on 16 November 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr P. Chapman of Mitchells Solicitors, a lawyer practising in York. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant complained, among other things, that he had been dismissed on account of his political views and membership of a political party.\n\nOn 7 January 2009 the Acting President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaints concerning Articles 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Bradford.\n\nThe applicant was employed by Serco Limited (“Serco”) from 5 December 2003 to his dismissal on 30 June 2004. Serco provided transport to local authorities, including Bradford City Council.\n\nThe applicant, who is white British, was employed formerly as a driver’s escort and latterly as a driver. As such, he was responsible for transporting children and adults with physical and/or mental disabilities within the Bradford area. The majority of his passengers were Asian in origin. There had been no complaints about his work or his conduct at work and his supervisor, who was of Asian origin, had nominated him for the award of “first-class employee”.\n\nOn 26 May 2004 a local newspaper article published in Bradford and the surrounding areas identified the applicant as a candidate for the British National Party (“the BNP”) in the forthcoming local elections. On the same day, the applicant was temporarily assigned to deliver mail to local council offices.\n\nAt the relevant time the BNP only extended membership to white nationals. According to its constitution it was: “wholly opposed to any form of integration between British and non-European peoples. It is therefore committed to stemming and reversing the tide of non-white immigration and to restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent, the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948.”\n\nOn 27 May 2004 UNISON, the public sector workers’ trade union, sent a letter to Serco stating that many of its members found the applicant’s continued employment a “significant cause for concern, bearing in mind the BNP’s overt and racist/fascist agenda.” The letter advised Serco that 70-80 percent of its customer base and 35 percent of its workforce were of Asian origin. UNISON asked that Serco take immediate action to ensure its members were not subjected to racial hatred. Another trade union, GMB, and a number of employees also made representations to Serco about the applicant’s continued employment.\n\nOn 15 June 2004 the applicant was elected as a local councillor for the BNP. After taking legal advice Serco summarily dismissed him on 30 June 2004. Serco cited, inter alia, potential health and safety risks as the applicant’s continued employment would give rise to considerable anxiety among passengers and their carers. It also expressed concern that the applicant’s continued employment could jeopardise its reputation and possibly lead to the loss of its contract with Bradford City Council.\n\nOrdinarily, one year’s service is required before an employee can bring an action for unfair dismissal under the Employment Rights Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”), although this qualifying period does not apply where the dismissal was on grounds of pregnancy, race, sex or religion. The applicant therefore lacked sufficient continuous service to bring an action for unfair dismissal. However, on 12 August 2004 he lodged a statutory claim of race discrimination in the Employment Tribunal pursuant to the Race Relations Act 1976 (“the 1976 Act”).\n\nThe applicant claimed that he had been unlawfully discriminated against as his dismissal constituted less favourable treatment on racial grounds. The racial grounds relied on were those of the passengers and employees of Serco who were of Asian origin. He further argued that since the BNP was a “whites-only” party, his dismissal also constituted indirect racial discrimination.\n\nThe Employment Tribunal gave judgment on 2 February 2005. It noted Serco’s concerns that the applicant’s continued employment might lead to difficulties with other employees; damage its relationship with the unions; lead to attacks on Serco’s minibuses which would jeopardise the health and safety of Serco’s staff, its vulnerable passengers, and the applicant himself; cause considerable anxiety amongst Serco’s passengers and those relatives/carers entrusting vulnerable passengers to its care; and damage its reputation so as potentially to place at risk existing contracts and future bids for work in the public sector and elsewhere.\n\nThe Employment Tribunal dismissed the claim of direct discrimination as it was satisfied that if any discrimination existed against the claimant it was not on racial grounds but rather on health and safety grounds. The Tribunal also dismissed the claim of indirect discrimination on the ground that the applicant’s dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, namely the maintenance of health and safety.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal with the Employment Appeal Tribunal. On 27 July 2005 his appeal was upheld on the ground that the Tribunal had erred in its construction of the phrase “on racial grounds” by failing to interpret its meaning broadly and had not indicated how it had come to the conclusion that the applicant’s dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving the aim of ensuring health and safety because, inter alia, there had been no consideration of any alternatives to dismissal.\n\nOn 9 September 2005 Serco was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 25 May 2006 the Court of Appeal allowed Serco’s appeal and restored the order of the Employment Tribunal. Mummery LJ found the applicant’s submission that he had been subjected to direct race discrimination to be wrong in principle and inconsistent with the purposes of the legislation.\n\nIn rejecting the claim of direct discrimination, the Court of Appeal noted that: “Mr Redfearn was treated less favourably not on the ground that he was white, but on the ground of a particular non-racial characteristic shared by him with a tiny proportion of the white population, that is membership of and standing for election for a political party like the BNP. Serco was not adopting a policy which discriminated on the basis of a dividing line of colour or race. Serco would apply the same approach to a member of a similar political party, which confined its membership to black people. The dividing line of colour or race was not made by Serco, but by the BNP which defines its own composition by colour or race. Mr Redfearn cannot credibly make a claim of direct race discrimination by Serco against him on the ground that he is white by relying on the decision of his own chosen political party to limit its membership to white people. The BNP cannot make a non-racial criterion (party membership) a racial one by the terms of its constitution limiting membership to white people. Properly analysed Mr Redfearn’s complaint is of discrimination on political grounds, which falls outside the anti-discrimination laws.”\n\nIn rejecting the claim of indirect discrimination, the following was noted: “For indirect discrimination ... it is necessary to identify a ‘provision, criterion or practice’ which Serco has applied or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or colour. ... Mr Redfearn ... failed to present the tribunal with a case, which satisfied the requisite elements of a claim for indirect race discrimination and upon which the tribunal could properly make a finding of indirect race discrimination.... The employment tribunal appears to have attempted itself a version of a ‘provision, criterion or practice’ in paragraph 5.6 of its decision (see paragraph 28 above). However, it is formulated too narrowly (membership of the BNP) to be meaningful. A provision of ‘membership of the BNP’ could not be applied to a person who was not of the same colour as Mr Redfearn, because only persons of the same colour as him (white) are eligible to be members of the BNP. A more general and meaningful provision along similar lines would be one applying to membership of a political organisation like the BNP, which existed to promote views hostile to members of a different colour than those that belonged to the organisation. If such a provision were applied, however, it would not put persons of the same race as Mr Redfearn ‘at a particular disadvantage’ when compared with other persons within section 1(1A) of the 1976 Act. All such political activists would be at the same disadvantage, whatever colour they were.”\n\nLastly, with regard to the applicant’s contention that he had been subjected to less favourable treatment arising from membership of a political party contrary to his Convention rights under Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 and that this should have been taken into account in deciding whether indirect discrimination had been justified, the Court of Appeal stated that: “The 1998 Act does not assist Mr Redfearn in this case. He is not entitled to make a claim under it as Serco is not a public authority. Section 3 of the 1998 Act does not assist, as there is no respect in which the relevant provisions of the 1976 Act are incompatible with the Convention rights. As for justification under the 1976 Act I have already explained that it does not arise, as no case of indirect discrimination has been made out.”\n\nThe applicant was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Arthur Collins Redfearn - The applicant, British national born in 1948, lives in Bradford, former Serco employee and BNP candidate who was dismissed from his job", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Arthur Collins Redfearn", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "76-77", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Bradford / United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "United Kingdom", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Unemployed", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "British National Party", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Local Councillor", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr P.

{"metadata": {"data_id": "TAB-cf246", "number_of_subjects": 3, "annotator": "annotator3", "notes": "original persona data"}, "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 33379/96) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Edgar Klein (“the applicant”), on 9 January 1996.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Hanau, director of the research institute for social law at the University of Köln (Germany). The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Klaus Stoltenberg, Ministerialdirigent, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the length of the civil proceedings were in breach of the “reasonable time” requirement laid down in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 14 January 1998 the Commission decided to communicate the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the civil proceedings and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nThe applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the civil proceedings was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nIt was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 9 December 1999 the Chamber declared the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the civil proceedings admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, born in 1926, is a German national and residing in Bad Neuenahr.\n\nOn 6 December 1985 the Rhineland Westphalia electricity-supply company instituted proceedings before the Moers District Court (Amtsgericht) against the applicant claiming outstanding payments for electricity.\n\nOn 28 April 1986 the District Court ordered the applicant to pay a sum of about 141 Deutsch Mark (DEM) as well as interest to the plaintiff. The Court found that the applicant had reduced the sums due following the annual statements of account, challenging the mode of calculation as well as the coal-mining contribution, a contribution earmarked as a subsidy for the national coal-mining industry (Kohlepfennig). The Court considered that both the mode of calculation and the contribution could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view.\n\nOn 8 June 1986 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht).\n\nOn 11 October 1994, after a series of hearings and after having received the observations of the Federal Government, the Government of Bavaria and the association of the German coal-mining industry (Gesamtverband des deutschen Steinkohlebergbaus), the Second Division (Senat) of the Federal Constitutional Court rendered a decision (of about 30 pages) upon the applicant's constitutional complaint. The Second Division declared that the relevant parts of the Act on the Use of EC Coal in the Electricity Supply (Gesetz über die weitere Sicherung des Einsatzes von Gemeinschaftskohle in der Elektrizitätswirtschaft), which were underlying the coal-mining contribution in question, were unconstitutional as the coal-mining contribution amounted to an inadmissible special levy (Sonderabgabe). The Federal Constitutional Court quashed the District Court's decision of April 1986 in as much as the payment of the contribution was concerned and sent the case back to that court. It further ordered that the legislation in question, to the extent that it was unconstitutional, should not be applied beyond 31 December 1995. The Constitutional Court did not entertain the applicant's complaint about the mode of calculation on the ground that the relevant regulations had changed meanwhile.\n\nOn 15 February 1995, in the resumed proceedings, the Moers District Court ordered the applicant to pay a sum of about 80 DEM as well as interest to the plaintiff. It found that, pursuant to the above legislation which continued to be in force until 31 December 1995, the applicant had to pay the above sum representing the coal-mining contribution.\n\nOn 22 August 1995 the Federal Constitutional Court refused a constitutional complaint by the applicant lodged on 24 May 1995. The applicant received the decision on 2 September 1995.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Mr Edgar Klein - German national born in 1926, residing in Bad Neuenahr, the applicant in the case who challenged electricity payments including coal-mining contribution", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Edgar Klein", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "98-99", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Bad Neuenahr / Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr Hanau - Director of the research institute for social law at the University of Köln, legal representative of the applicant", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Mr Hanau", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Köln / Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 4, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Director of research institute for social law", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "University of Köln", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Agent", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}, {"id": 2, "description": "Mr Klaus Stoltenberg - Ministerialdirigent of the Federal Ministry of Justice, Agent representing the German Government", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Klaus Stoltenberg", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Male", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 4}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Germany", "certainty": 3, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "College Degree", "certainty": 2, "hardness": 5}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "Ministerialdirigent", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "Federal Ministry of Justice", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "Agent", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}]}]}

Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Lustenau. Her father is an Austrian national of Turkish origin. In February 1998 she entered Austria on a temporary visa, valid until 30 June 1998.\n\nFollowing a report by the Dornbirn Aliens Police (Fremdenpolizei), on 28 January 1999 the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority issued a provisional penal order (Strafverfügung) of 1,000 Austrian schillings (ATS) – equal to 73 Euros (EUR) and 24 hours’ imprisonment in default against the applicant for illegal sojourn.\n\nSubsequently, on 11 February 1999, she filed an objection (Einspruch) against that decision with the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority.\n\nOn 22 March 1999 the applicant, upon the District Administrative Authority’s request, filed a statement in which she specified that she had entered Austria with a valid visa on 26 February 1998. As proceedings for a residence permit were underway, she was in her view allowed to stay until the decision had become final. In addition she claimed that, according to certain EC directives and the Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence and in line with the ECJ’s constant case-law, she was legally residing in Austria, since her father had Austrian citizenship.\n\nThe Aliens Police submitted their observations on 16 August 1999, which were served on the applicant’s counsel on 23 August 1999. They stated that neither European Law nor domestic provisions could justify the applicant’s sojourn in Austria, which was in fact in breach of section 31 of the Aliens Act.\n\nOn 21 December 1999 the applicant filed further observations.\n\nOn 1 December 2000 the District Administrative Authority, having regard to the applicant’s objection and the above investigations, maintained its view and imposed a penal order in the amount of ATS 1,000 with 30 hours’ imprisonment in default. It found that although the applicant had entered with a valid visa, it had expired, following which her stay in Austria was in breach of the Aliens Act.\n\nOn 19 December 2000 the applicant filed an appeal with the Independent Administrative Panel (IAP). She alleged, inter alia, that the first-instance decision did not comply with EC law.\n\nHaving held an oral hearing, on 25 June 2001 the IAP , dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It referred to the Aliens Act, which exhaustively stipulated the conditions under which a foreigner’s residence could be deemed to be legal. Upholding the first-instance decision, it concluded that the applicant had disregarded her visa’s validity period, following which her sojourn was unlawful.\n\nSubsequently, on 13 August 2001, the applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court.\n\nOn 10 October 2001 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the case on account of its lack of prospects of success and transferred it to the Administrative Court.\n\nThe IAP submitted its observations to the Administrative Court on 25 October 2001.\n\nOn 19 November 2003 the Administrative Court, relying on section 33a of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichts-hofgesetz), declined to deal with the applicant’s case, finding that it did not raise important legal issues. On 1 December 2003 that decision was served on the applicant’s counsel.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Ms Ilknur Gursoy - Turkish national applicant, born in 1977, lives in Lustenau, entered Austria on temporary visa in February 1998", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Ilknur Gursoy", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "47-48", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Lustenau / Austria", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Türkiye", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr W.L.

Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the civil proceedings in his case exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 19 March 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Warszawa.\n\nIn 1962 the applicant was injured in a train accident. Her injury caused her permanent disability and she was unable to continue her employment.\n\nAs from 1963 the applicant was in receipt of a monthly supplementary disability pension from the Central Direction of the State Railways (CDOKP: hereinafter “the State Railways”). By a decision of 15 March 1993 the State Railways reduced the applicant's supplementary pension, considering that she had reached pensionable age. The applicant objected to this decision.\n\nOn 16 February 1994 the State Railways lodged a motion with the Warsaw District Court in order to have the amount of the applicant's pension fixed. The court held three hearings, respectively on 10 May, on 7 July and on 26 September 1994.\n\nBy a judgment of 6 October 1994 the Warsaw District Court dismissed the claim and ordered the State Railways to pay the pension in the sum which it had hitherto paid her, considering that the applicant's reduced earning power had to be taken into account.\n\nOn 23 November 1994 the State Railways lodged an appeal with the Warsaw Regional Court.\n\nBy a decision of 19 January 1995 the Warsaw Regional Court quashed the judgment of 6 October 1994 and ordered that the case be remitted to the Warsaw District Court for reconsideration.\n\nOn 19 September 1995 the first hearing was held before the Warsaw District Court. New expert evidence was ordered to be taken in September 1996. The expert report was submitted to the court in May 1998. The next hearing was held on 12 January 1999, but both the plaintiff's representative and the applicant's legal representative appointed by the court under the legal aid scheme failed to attend.\n\nBy a judgment of 4 January 2000 the Warsaw District Court dismissed the appeal of the State Railways and ruled that the applicant's pension should not be reduced.\n\nOn 7 April 2000 the State Railways lodged an appeal against this judgment. On 4 July 2000 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the reasoning of the first-instance court.", "subjects": [{"id": 0, "description": "Urszula Surman-Januszewska - The applicant, Polish national born in 1930, lives in Warsaw, injured in 1962 train accident causing permanent disability, recipient of supplementary disability pension", "PIIs": [{"tag": "NAME", "keyword": "Urszula Surman-Januszewska", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "DRIVER_LICENSE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PHONE_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "PASSPORT_NUMBER", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "SEX", "keyword": "Female", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 3}, {"tag": "AGE", "keyword": "94-95", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 2}, {"tag": "LOCATION", "keyword": "Warsaw / Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "NATIONALITY", "keyword": "Poland", "certainty": 5, "hardness": 1}, {"tag": "EDUCATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "RELATIONSHIP", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "OCCUPATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "AFFILIATION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}, {"tag": "POSITION", "keyword": "", "certainty": 0, "hardness": 0}]}, {"id": 1, "description": "Mr K.
